Wait and Sons, Printers.\\r\\n\\r\\n1815.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPREFACE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall not imitate the invidious example of some authors, who think\\r\\nit necessary to destroy the edifices of others, in order to clear the\\r\\nway for their own. We have no peculiar system to support, and,\\r\\nconsequently, we have no temptation to attack the theories of others;\\r\\nand we have chosen the title of Practical Education, to point out that\\r\\nwe rely entirely upon practice and experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make any progress in the art of education, it must be patiently\\r\\nreduced to an experimental science: we are fully sensible of the\\r\\nextent and difficulty of this undertaking, and we have not the\\r\\narrogance to imagine, that we have made any considerable progress in a\\r\\nwork, which the labours of many generations may, perhaps, be\\r\\ninsufficient to complete; but we lay before the publick the result of\\r\\nour experiments, and in many instances the experiments themselves. In\\r\\npursuing this part of our plan, we have sometimes descended from that\\r\\nelevation of style, which the reader might expect in a quarto volume;\\r\\nwe have frequently been obliged to record facts concerning children\\r\\nwhich may seem trifling, and to enter into a minuteness of detail\\r\\nwhich may appear unnecessary. No anecdotes, however, have been\\r\\nadmitted without due deliberation; nothing has been introduced to\\r\\ngratify the idle curiosity of others, or to indulge our own feelings\\r\\nof domestic partiality.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn what we have written upon the rudiments of science, we have pursued\\r\\nan opposite plan; so far from attempting to teach them in detail, we\\r\\nrefer our readers to the excellent treatises on the different branches\\r\\nof science, and on the various faculties of the human mind, which are\\r\\nto be found in every language. The chapters that we have introduced\\r\\nupon these subjects, are intended merely as specimens of the manner in\\r\\nwhich we think young children should be taught. We have found from\\r\\nexperience, that an early knowledge of the first principles of science\\r\\nmay be given in conversation, and may be insensibly acquired from the\\r\\nusual incidents of life: if this knowledge be carefully associated\\r\\nwith the technical terms which common use may preserve in the memory,\\r\\nmuch of the difficulty of subsequent instruction may be avoided.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sketches we have hazarded upon these subjects, may to some appear\\r\\ntoo slight, and to others too abstruse and tedious. To those who have\\r\\nexplored the vast mines of human knowledge, small specimens appear\\r\\ntrifling and contemptible, whilst the less accustomed eye is somewhat\\r\\ndazzled and confused by the appearance even of a small collection: but\\r\\nto the most enlightened minds, new combinations may be suggested by a\\r\\nnew arrangement of materials, and the curiosity and enthusiasm of the\\r\\ninexperienced may be awakened, and excited to accurate and laborious\\r\\nresearches.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith respect to what is commonly called the education of the heart, we\\r\\nhave endeavoured to suggest the easiest means of inducing useful and\\r\\nagreeable habits, well regulated sympathy and benevolent affections. A\\r\\nwitty writer says, \"Il est permis d\\'ennuyer en moralites d\\'ici jusqu\\'\\r\\na Constantinople.\" Unwilling to avail ourselves of this permission, we\\r\\nhave sedulously avoided declamation, and, wherever we have been\\r\\nobliged to repeat ancient maxims, and common truths, we have at least\\r\\nthought it becoming to present them in a new dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn religion and politics we have been silent, because we have no\\r\\nambition to gain partisans, or to make proselytes, and because we do\\r\\nnot address ourselves exclusively to any sect or to any party. The\\r\\nscrutinizing eye of criticism, in looking over our table of contents,\\r\\nwill also, probably, observe that there are no chapters on courage and\\r\\nchastity. To pretend to teach courage to Britons, would be as\\r\\nridiculous as it is unnecessary; and, except amongst those who are\\r\\nexposed to the contagion of foreign manners, we may boast of the\\r\\nsuperior delicacy of our fair countrywomen; a delicacy acquired from\\r\\ndomestic example, and confirmed by publick approbation. Our opinions\\r\\nconcerning the female character and understanding, have been fully\\r\\ndetailed in a former publication;[1] and, unwilling to fatigue by\\r\\nrepetition, we have touched but slightly upon these subjects in our\\r\\nchapters on Temper, Female Accomplishments, Prudence, and Economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have warned our readers not to expect from us any new theory of\\r\\neducation, but they need not apprehend that we have written without\\r\\nmethod, or that we have thrown before them a heap of desultory remarks\\r\\nand experiments, which lead to no general conclusions, and which tend\\r\\nto the establishment of no useful principles. We assure them that we\\r\\nhave worked upon a regular plan, and where we have failed of executing\\r\\nour design, it has not been for want of labour or attention. Convinced\\r\\nthat it is the duty and the interest of all who write, to inquire what\\r\\nothers have said and thought upon the subject of which they treat, we\\r\\nhave examined attentively the works of others, that we might collect\\r\\nwhatever knowledge they contain, and that we might neither arrogate\\r\\ninventions which do not belong to us, nor weary the public by\\r\\nrepetition. Some useful and ingenious essays may probably have escaped\\r\\nour notice; but we flatter ourselves, that our readers will not find\\r\\nreason to accuse us of negligence, as we have perused with diligent\\r\\nattention every work upon education, that has obtained the sanction of\\r\\ntime or of public approbation, and, though we have never bound\\r\\nourselves to the letter, we hope that we have been faithful to the\\r\\nspirit, of their authors. Without incumbering ourselves with any part\\r\\nof their systems which has not been authorized by experience, we have\\r\\nsteadily attempted immediately to apply to practice such of their\\r\\nideas as we have thought useful; but whilst we have used the thoughts\\r\\nof others, we have been anxious to avoid mean plagiarism, and wherever\\r\\nwe have borrowed, the debt has been carefully acknowledged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first hint of the chapter on Toys was received from Dr. Beddoes;\\r\\nthe sketch of an introduction to chemistry for children was given to\\r\\nus by Mr. Lovell Edgeworth; and the rest of the work was resumed from\\r\\na design formed and begun twenty years ago. When a book appears under\\r\\nthe name of two authors, it is natural to inquire what share belongs\\r\\nto each of them. All that relates to the art of teaching to read in\\r\\nthe chapter on Tasks, the chapters on Grammar and Classical\\r\\nLiterature, Geography, Chronology, Arithmetic, Geometry, and\\r\\nMechanics, were written by Mr. Edgeworth, and the rest of the book by\\r\\nMiss Edgeworth. She was encouraged and enabled to write upon this\\r\\nimportant subject, by having for many years before her eyes the\\r\\nconduct of a judicious mother in the education of a large family. The\\r\\nchapter on Obedience, was written from Mrs. Edgeworth\\'s notes, and was\\r\\nexemplified by her successful practice in the management of her\\r\\nchildren; the whole manuscript was submitted to her judgment, and she\\r\\nrevised parts of it in the last stage of a fatal disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] Letters for Literary Ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONTENTS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter                                                         Page\\r\\n\\r\\n     I. _Toys_                                                     9\\r\\n    II. _Tasks_                                                   40\\r\\n   III. _On Attention_                                            71\\r\\n    IV. _Servants_                                               109\\r\\n     V. _Acquaintance_                                           121\\r\\n    VI. _On Temper_                                              137\\r\\n   VII. _On Obedience_                                           153\\r\\n  VIII. _On Truth_                                               168\\r\\n    IX. _On Rewards and Punishments_                             198\\r\\n     X. _On Sympathy and Sensibility_                            232\\r\\n    XI. _On Vanity, Pride, and Ambition_                         261\\r\\n   XII. _Books_                                                  276\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPRACTICAL EDUCATION.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I.\\r\\n\\r\\nTOYS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why don\\'t you play with your playthings, my dear? I am sure that I\\r\\nhave bought toys enough for you; why can\\'t you divert yourself with\\r\\nthem, instead of breaking them to pieces?\" says a mother to her child,\\r\\nwho stands idle and miserable, surrounded by disjointed dolls, maimed\\r\\nhorses, coaches and one-horse chairs without wheels, and a nameless\\r\\nwreck of gilded lumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nA child in this situation is surely more to be pitied than blamed; for\\r\\nis it not vain to repeat, \"Why don\\'t you play with your playthings,\"\\r\\nunless they be such as he can play with, which is very seldom the\\r\\ncase; and is it not rather unjust to be angry with him for breaking\\r\\nthem to pieces, when he can by no other device render them subservient\\r\\nto his amusement? He breaks them, not from the love of mischief, but\\r\\nfrom the hatred of idleness; either he wishes to see what his\\r\\nplaythings are made of, and how they are made; or, whether he can put\\r\\nthem together again, if the parts be once separated. All this is\\r\\nperfectly innocent; and it is a pity that his love of knowledge and\\r\\nhis spirit of activity should be repressed by the undistinguishing\\r\\ncorrection of a nursery maid, or the unceasing reproof of a French\\r\\ngoverness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more natural vivacity and ingenuity young people possess, the\\r\\nless are they likely to be amused with the toys which are usually put\\r\\ninto their hands. They require to have things which exercise their\\r\\nsenses or their imagination, their imitative, and inventive powers.\\r\\nThe glaring colours, or the gilding of toys, may catch the eye, and\\r\\nplease for a few minutes, but unless some use can be made of them,\\r\\nthey will, and ought, to be soon discarded. A boy, who has the use of\\r\\nhis limbs, and whose mind is untainted with prejudice, would, in all\\r\\nprobability, prefer a substantial cart, in which he could carry weeds,\\r\\nearth and stones, up and down hill, to the finest frail coach and six\\r\\nthat ever came out of a toy-shop: for what could he do with the coach\\r\\nafter having admired, and sucked the paint, but drag it cautiously\\r\\nalong the carpet of a drawing-room, watching the wheels, which will\\r\\nnot turn, and seeming to sympathize with the just terrors of the lady\\r\\nand gentleman within, who are certain of being overturned every five\\r\\nminutes? When he is tired of this, perhaps, he may set about to\\r\\nunharness horses which were never meant to be unharnessed; or to\\r\\ncurrycomb their woollen manes and tails, which usually come off during\\r\\nthe first attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat such toys are frail and useless, may, however, be considered as\\r\\nevils comparatively small: as long as the child has sense and courage\\r\\nto destroy the toys, there is no great harm done; but, in general, he\\r\\nis taught to set a value upon them totally independent of all ideas of\\r\\nutility, or of any regard to his own real feelings. Either he is\\r\\nconjured to take particular care of them, because they cost a great\\r\\ndeal of money; or else he is taught to admire them as miniatures of\\r\\nsome of the fine things on which fine people pride themselves: if no\\r\\nother bad consequence were to ensue, this single circumstance of his\\r\\nbeing guided in his choice by the opinion of others is dangerous.\\r\\nInstead of attending to his own sensations, and learning from his own\\r\\nexperience, he acquires the habit of estimating his pleasures by the\\r\\ntaste and judgment of those who happen to be near him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I liked the cart best,\" says the boy, \"but mamma and every body said\\r\\nthat the coach was the prettiest; so I chose the coach.\"--Shall we\\r\\nwonder if the same principle afterwards governs him in the choice of\\r\\n\"the toys of age?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA little girl, presiding at her baby tea-table, is pleased with the\\r\\nnotion that she is like her mamma; and, before she can have any idea\\r\\nof the real pleasures of conversation and society, she is confirmed in\\r\\nthe persuasion, that tattling and visiting are some of the most\\r\\nenviable privileges of grown people; a set of beings whom she believes\\r\\nto be in possession of all the sweets of happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolls, beside the prescriptive right of ancient usage, can boast of\\r\\nsuch an able champion in Rousseau, that it requires no common share of\\r\\ntemerity to attack them. As far as they are the means of inspiring\\r\\ngirls with a taste for neatness in dress, and with a desire to make\\r\\nthose things for themselves, for which women are usually dependent\\r\\nupon milliners, we must acknowledge their utility; but a watchful eye\\r\\nshould be kept upon the child, to mark the first symptoms of a love of\\r\\nfinery and fashion. It is a sensible remark of a late female writer,\\r\\nthat whilst young people work, the mind will follow the hands, the\\r\\nthoughts are occupied with trifles, and the industry is stimulated by\\r\\nvanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur objections to dolls are offered with great submission and due\\r\\nhesitation. With more confidence we may venture to attack baby-houses;\\r\\nan unfurnished baby-house might be a good toy, as it would employ\\r\\nlittle carpenters and seamstresses to fit it up; but a completely\\r\\nfurnished baby-house proves as tiresome to a child, as a finished seat\\r\\nis to a young nobleman. After peeping, for in general only a peep can\\r\\nbe had into each apartment, after being thoroughly satisfied that\\r\\nnothing is wanting, and that consequently there is nothing to be done,\\r\\nthe young lady lays her doll upon the state bed, if the doll be not\\r\\ntwice as large as the bed, and falls fast asleep in the midst of her\\r\\nfelicity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore dolls, baby-houses, coaches, and cups and saucers, there comes\\r\\na set of toys, which are made to imitate the actions of men and women,\\r\\nand the notes or noises of birds and beasts. Many of these are\\r\\ningenious in their construction, and happy in their effect, but that\\r\\neffect unfortunately is transitory. When the wooden woman has churned\\r\\nher hour in her empty churn; when the stiff backed man has hammered or\\r\\nsawed till his arms are broken, or till his employers are tired; when\\r\\nthe gilt lamb has ba-ad, the obstinate pig squeaked, and the provoking\\r\\ncuckoo cried cuckoo, till no one in the house can endure the noise;\\r\\nwhat remains to be done?--Wo betide the unlucky little philosopher,\\r\\nwho should think of inquiring why the woman churned, or how the bird\\r\\ncried cuckoo; for it is ten to one that in prosecuting such an\\r\\ninquiry, just when he is upon the eve of discovery, he snaps the wire,\\r\\nor perforates the bellows, and there ensue \"a death-like silence, and\\r\\na dread repose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grief which is felt for spoiling a new plaything might be borne,\\r\\nif it were not increased, as it commonly is, by the reproaches of\\r\\nfriends; much kind eloquence, upon these occasions, is frequently\\r\\ndisplayed, to bring the sufferer to a proper sense of his folly, till\\r\\nin due time the contrite corners of his mouth are drawn down, his wide\\r\\neyes fill with tears, and, without knowing what he means, he promises\\r\\nnever to be so silly any more. The future safety of his worthless\\r\\nplaythings is thus purchased at the expense of his understanding,\\r\\nperhaps of his integrity: for children seldom scrupulously adhere to\\r\\npromises, which they have made to escape from impending punishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have ventured to object to some fashionable toys; we are bound at\\r\\nleast to propose others in their place; and we shall take the matter\\r\\nup soberly from the nursery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first toys for infants should be merely such things as may be\\r\\ngrasped without danger, and which might, by the difference of their\\r\\nsizes, invite comparison: round ivory or wooden sticks should be put\\r\\ninto their little hands; by degrees they will learn to lift them to\\r\\ntheir mouths, and they will distinguish their sizes: square and\\r\\ncircular bits of wood, balls, cubes, and triangles, with holes of\\r\\ndifferent sizes made in them, to admit the sticks, should be their\\r\\nplaythings. No greater apparatus is necessary for the amusement of the\\r\\nfirst months of an infant\\'s life. To ease the pain which they feel\\r\\nfrom cutting teeth, infants generally carry to their mouths whatever\\r\\nthey can lay their hands upon; but they soon learn to distinguish\\r\\nthose bodies which relieve their pain, from those which gratify their\\r\\npalate; and, if they are left to themselves, they will always choose\\r\\nwhat is painted in preference to every thing else; nor must we\\r\\nattribute the look of delight with which they seize toys that are\\r\\npainted red, merely to the pleasure which their eye takes in the\\r\\nbright colour, but to the love of the sweet taste which they suck from\\r\\nthe paint. What injury may be done to the health by the quantity of\\r\\nlead which is thus swallowed, we will not pretend to determine, but we\\r\\nrefer to a medical name of high authority,[2] whose cautions probably\\r\\nwill not be treated with neglect. To gratify the eye with glittering\\r\\nobjects, if this be necessary, may be done with more safety by toys of\\r\\ntin and polished iron: a common steel button is a more desirable\\r\\nplaything to a young child than many expensive toys; a few such\\r\\nbuttons tied together, so as to prevent any danger of their being\\r\\nswallowed, would continue for some time a source of amusement.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a nurse wants to please or to pacify a child, she stuns its ear\\r\\nwith a variety of noises, or dazzles its eye with glaring colours or\\r\\nstimulating light. The eye and the ear are thus fatigued without\\r\\nadvantage, and the temper is hushed to a transient calm by expedients,\\r\\nwhich in time must lose their effect, and which can have no power over\\r\\nconfirmed fretfulness. The pleasure of exercising their senses, is in\\r\\nitself sufficient to children without any factitious stimulus, which\\r\\nonly exhausts their excitability, and renders them incapable of being\\r\\namused by a variety of common objects, which would naturally be their\\r\\nentertainment. We do not here speak of the attempts made to sooth a\\r\\nchild who is ill; \"to charm the sense of pain,\" so far as it can be\\r\\ndone by diverting the child\\'s attention from his own sufferings to\\r\\noutward objects, is humane and reasonable, provided our compassion\\r\\ndoes not induce in the child\\'s mind the expectation of continual\\r\\nattendance, and that impatience of temper which increases bodily\\r\\nsuffering. It would be in vain to read lectures on philosophy to a\\r\\nnurse, or to expect stoicism from an infant; but, perhaps, where\\r\\nmothers pay attention themselves to their children, they will be able\\r\\nto prevent many of the consequences of vulgar prejudice and folly. A\\r\\nnurse\\'s wish is to have as little trouble as possible with the child\\r\\ncommitted to her charge, and at the same time to flatter the mother,\\r\\nfrom whom she expects her reward. The appearance of extravagant\\r\\nfondness for the child, of incessant attention to its humour, and\\r\\nabsurd submission to its caprices, she imagines to be the surest\\r\\nmethod of recommending herself to favour. She is not to be imposed\\r\\nupon by the faint and affected rebukes of the fond mother, who\\r\\nexclaims, \"Oh, nurse, indeed you _do_ spoil that child sadly!--Oh,\\r\\nnurse, upon my word she governs you entirely!--Nurse, you must not let\\r\\nher have her own way always.--Never mind her crying, I beg,\\r\\nnurse.\"--Nurse smiles, sees that she has gained her point, and\\r\\npromises what she knows it is not expected she should perform. Now if,\\r\\non the contrary, she perceived that the mother was neither to be\\r\\nflattered nor pleased by these means, one motive for spoiling the\\r\\nchild would immediately cease: another strong one would, it is true,\\r\\nstill remain. A nurse wishes to save herself trouble, and she\\r\\nfrequently consults her own convenience when she humours an infant.\\r\\nShe hushes it to sleep, that she may leave it safely; she stops it\\r\\nfrom crying, that she may not hear an irritating noise, that she may\\r\\nrelieve herself as soon as possible from the painful weakness of\\r\\ncompassion, or that she may avoid the danger of being interrogated by\\r\\nthe family as to the cause of the disturbance. It is less trouble to\\r\\nher to yield to caprice and ill-humour than to prevent or cure it, or\\r\\nat least she thinks it is so. In reality it is not; for an humoured\\r\\nchild in time plagues its attendant infinitely more than it would have\\r\\ndone with reasonable management. If it were possible to convince\\r\\nnurses of this, they would sacrifice perhaps the convenience of a\\r\\nmoment to the peace of future hours, and they would not be eager to\\r\\nquell one storm, at the hazard of being obliged to endure twenty more\\r\\nboisterous; the candle would then no more be thrust almost into the\\r\\ninfant\\'s eyes to make it take notice of the light through the mist of\\r\\ntears, the eternal bunch of keys would not dance and jingle at every\\r\\npeevish summons, nor would the roarings of passion be overpowered by\\r\\ninsulting songs, or soothed by artful caresses; the child would then\\r\\nbe caressed and amused when he looks smiling and good-humoured, and\\r\\nall parties would be much happier.\\r\\n\\r\\nPractical education begins very early, even in the nursery. Without\\r\\nthe mountebank pretence, that miracles can be performed by the turning\\r\\nof a straw, or the dictatorial anathematizing tone, which calls down\\r\\nvengeance upon those who do not follow to an iota the injunctions of a\\r\\ntheorist, we may simply observe, that parents would save themselves a\\r\\ngreat deal of trouble, and their children some pain, if they would\\r\\npay some attention to their early education. The temper acquires\\r\\nhabits much earlier than is usually apprehended; the first impressions\\r\\nwhich infants receive, and the first habits which they learn from\\r\\ntheir nurses, influence the temper and disposition long after the\\r\\nslight causes which produced them are forgotten. More care and\\r\\njudgment than usually fall to the share of a nurse are necessary, to\\r\\ncultivate the disposition which infants show, to exercise their\\r\\nsenses, so as neither to suffer them to become indolent and torpid\\r\\nfrom want of proper objects to occupy their attention, nor yet to\\r\\nexhaust their senses by continual excitation. By ill-timed restraints\\r\\nor injudicious incitements, the nurse frequently renders the child\\r\\nobstinate or passionate. An infant should never be interrupted in its\\r\\noperations; whilst it wishes to use its hands, we should not be\\r\\nimpatient to make it walk; or when it is pacing, with all the\\r\\nattention to its centre of gravity that is exerted by a rope-dancer,\\r\\nsuddenly arrest its progress, and insist upon its pronouncing the\\r\\nscanty vocabulary which we have compelled it to learn. When children\\r\\nare busily trying experiments upon objects within their reach, we\\r\\nshould not, by way of saving them trouble, break the course of their\\r\\nideas, and totally prevent them from acquiring knowledge by their own\\r\\nexperience. When a foolish nurse sees a child attempting to reach or\\r\\nlift any thing, she runs immediately, \"Oh, dear love, it can\\'t do it,\\r\\nit can\\'t!--I\\'ll do it for it, so I will!\"--If the child be trying the\\r\\ndifference between pushing and pulling, rolling or sliding, the powers\\r\\nof the wedge or the lever, the officious nurse hastens instantly to\\r\\ndisplay her own knowledge of the mechanic powers: \"Stay, love, stay;\\r\\nthat is not the way to do it--I\\'ll show it the right way--see\\r\\nhere--look at me love.\"--Without interrupting a child in the moment of\\r\\naction, proper care might previously be taken to remove out of its way\\r\\nthose things which can really hurt it, and a just degree of attention\\r\\nmust be paid to its first experiments upon hard and heavy, and more\\r\\nespecially upon sharp, brittle, and burning bodies; but this degree of\\r\\ncare should not degenerate into cowardice; it is better that a child\\r\\nshould tumble down or burn its fingers, than that it should not learn\\r\\nthe use of its limbs and its senses. We should for another reason take\\r\\ncare to put all dangerous things effectually out of the child\\'s reach,\\r\\ninstead of saying perpetually, \"Take care, don\\'t touch that!--don\\'t do\\r\\nthat!--let that alone!\" The child, who scarcely understands the words,\\r\\nand not at all the reason of these prohibitions, is frightened by the\\r\\ntone and countenance with which they are uttered and accompanied; and\\r\\nhe either becomes indolent or cunning; either he desists from\\r\\nexertion, or seizes the moment to divert himself with forbidden\\r\\nobjects, when the watchful eye that guards them is withdrawn. It is in\\r\\nvain to encompass the restless prisoner with a fortification of\\r\\nchairs, and to throw him an old almanack to tear to pieces, or an old\\r\\npincushion to explore; the enterprising adventurer soon makes his\\r\\nescape from this barricado, leaves his goods behind him, and presently\\r\\nis again in what the nurse calls mischief.\\r\\n\\r\\nMischief is with nurses frequently only another name for any species\\r\\nof activity which they find troublesome; the love which children are\\r\\nsupposed to have for pulling things out of their places, is in reality\\r\\nthe desire of seeing things in motion, or of putting things into\\r\\ndifferent situations. They will like to put the furniture in a room in\\r\\nits proper place, and to arrange every thing in what we call order, if\\r\\nwe can make these equally permanent sources of active amusement; but\\r\\nwhen things are once in their places, the child has nothing more to\\r\\ndo, and the more quickly each chair arrives at its destined situation,\\r\\nthe sooner comes the dreaded state of idleness and quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nA nursery, or a room in which young children are to live, should\\r\\nnever have any furniture in it which they can spoil; as few things as\\r\\npossible should be left within their reach which they are not to\\r\\ntouch, and at the same time they should be provided with the means of\\r\\namusing themselves, not with painted or gilt toys, but with pieces of\\r\\nwood of various shapes and sizes, which they may build up and pull\\r\\ndown, and put in a variety of different forms and positions; balls,\\r\\npulleys, wheels, strings, and strong little carts, proportioned to\\r\\ntheir age, and to the things which they want to carry in them, should\\r\\nbe their playthings.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrints will be entertaining to children at a very early age; it would\\r\\nbe endless to enumerate the uses that may be made of them; they teach\\r\\naccuracy of sight, they engage the attention, and employ the\\r\\nimagination. In 1777 we saw L----, a child of two years old, point out\\r\\nevery piece of furniture in the French prints of Gil Blas; in the\\r\\nprint of the Canon at Dinner, he distinguished the knives, forks,\\r\\nspoons, bottles, and every thing upon the table: the dog lying upon\\r\\nthe mat, and the bunch of keys hanging at Jacintha\\'s girdle; he told,\\r\\nwith much readiness, the occupation of every figure in the print, and\\r\\ncould supply, from his imagination, what is supposed to be hidden by\\r\\nthe foremost parts of all the objects. A child of four years old was\\r\\nasked, what was meant by something that was very indistinctly\\r\\nrepresented as hanging round the arm of a figure in one of the prints\\r\\nof the London Cries. He said it was a glove; though it had as little\\r\\nresemblance to a glove, as to a ribbon or a purse. When he was asked\\r\\nhow he knew that it was a glove, he answered, \"that it ought to be a\\r\\nglove, because the woman had one upon her other arm, and none upon\\r\\nthat where the thing was hanging.\" Having seen the gown of a female\\r\\nfigure in a print hanging obliquely, the same child said, \"The wind\\r\\nblows that woman\\'s gown back.\" We mention these little circumstances\\r\\nfrom real life, to show how early prints may be an amusement to\\r\\nchildren, and how quickly things unknown, are learnt by the relations\\r\\nwhich they bear to what was known before. We should at the same time\\r\\nobserve, that children are very apt to make strange mistakes, and\\r\\nhasty conclusions, when they begin to reason from analogy. A child\\r\\nhaving asked what was meant by some marks in the forehead of an old\\r\\nman in a print; and having been told, upon some occasion, that old\\r\\npeople were wiser than young ones, brought a print containing several\\r\\nfigures to his mother, and told her that _one_, which he pointed to,\\r\\nwas wiser than all the rest; upon inquiry, it was found that he had\\r\\nformed this notion from seeing that one figure was wrinkled, and that\\r\\nthe others were not.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrints for children should be chosen with great care; they should\\r\\nrepresent objects which are familiar; the resemblances should be\\r\\naccurate, and the manners should be attended to, or at least, the\\r\\ngeneral moral that is to be drawn from them. The attitude of Sephora,\\r\\nthe boxing lady in Gil Blas, must appear unnatural to children who\\r\\nhave not lived with termagant heroines. Perhaps, the first ideas of\\r\\ngrace, beauty, and propriety, are considerably influenced by the first\\r\\npictures and prints which please children. Sir Joshua Reynolds tells\\r\\nus, that he took a child with him through a room full of pictures, and\\r\\nthat the child stopped, with signs of aversion, whenever it came to\\r\\nany picture of a figure in a constrained attitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren soon judge tolerably well of proportion in drawing, where\\r\\nthey have been used to see the objects which are represented: but we\\r\\noften give them prints of objects, and of animals especially, which\\r\\nthey have never seen, and in which no sort of proportion is observed.\\r\\nThe common prints of animals must give children false ideas. The mouse\\r\\nand the elephant are nearly of the same size, and the crocodile and\\r\\nwhale fill the same space in the page. Painters, who put figures of\\r\\nmen amongst their buildings, give the idea of the proportionate\\r\\nheight immediately to the eye: this is, perhaps, the best scale we can\\r\\nadopt; in every print for children this should be attended to. Some\\r\\nidea of the relative sizes of the animals they see represented would\\r\\nthen be given, and the imagination would not be filled with chimeras.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having been accustomed to examine prints, and to trace their\\r\\nresemblance to real objects, children will probably wish to try their\\r\\nown powers of imitation. At this moment no toy, which we could invent\\r\\nfor them, would give them half so much pleasure as a pencil. If we put\\r\\na pencil into their hands even before they are able to do any thing\\r\\nwith it but make random marks all over a sheet of paper, it will long\\r\\ncontinue a real amusement and occupation. No matter how rude their\\r\\nfirst attempts at imitation may be; if the attention of children be\\r\\noccupied, our point is gained. Girls have generally one advantage at\\r\\nthis age over boys, in the exclusive possession of the scissors: how\\r\\nmany camels, and elephants with amazing trunks, are cut out by the\\r\\nindustrious scissors of a busy, and therefore happy little girl,\\r\\nduring a winter evening, which passes so heavily, and appears so\\r\\nimmeasurably long, to the idle.\\r\\n\\r\\nModelling in clay or wax might probably be a useful amusement about\\r\\nthis age, if the materials were so prepared, that the children could\\r\\navoid being every moment troublesome to others whilst they are at\\r\\nwork. The making of baskets, and the weaving of sash-line, might\\r\\nperhaps be employment for children; with proper preparations, they\\r\\nmight at least be occupied with these things; much, perhaps, might not\\r\\nbe produced by their labours, but it is a great deal to give early\\r\\nhabits of industry. Let us do what we will, every person who has ever\\r\\nhad any experience upon the subject, must know that it is scarcely\\r\\npossible to provide sufficient and suitable occupations for young\\r\\nchildren: this is one of the first difficulties in education. Those\\r\\nwho have never tried the experiment, are astonished to find it such a\\r\\ndifficult and laborious business as it really is, to find employments\\r\\nfor children from three to six years old. It is perhaps better, that\\r\\nour pupils should be entirely idle, than that they should be half\\r\\nemployed. \"My dear, have you nothing to do?\" should be spoken in\\r\\nsorrow rather than in anger. When they see other people employed and\\r\\nhappy, children feel mortified and miserable to have nothing to do.\\r\\nCount Rumford\\'s was an excellent scheme for exciting sympathetic\\r\\nindustry amongst the children of the poor at Munich; in the large\\r\\nhall, where the elder children were busy in spinning, there was a\\r\\nrange of seats for the younger children, who were not yet permitted to\\r\\nwork; these being compelled to sit idle, and to see the busy\\r\\nmultitude, grew extremely uneasy in their own situation, and became\\r\\nvery anxious to be employed. We need not use any compulsion or any\\r\\nartifice; parents in every family, we suppose, who think of educating\\r\\ntheir own children, are employed some hours in the day in reading,\\r\\nwriting, business, or conversation; during these hours, children will\\r\\nnaturally feel the want of occupation, and will, from sympathy, from\\r\\nambition and from impatience of insupportable ennui, desire with\\r\\nanxious faces, \"to have something to do.\" Instead of loading them with\\r\\nplaythings, by way of relieving their misery, we should honestly tell\\r\\nthem, if that be the truth, \"I am sorry I cannot find any thing for\\r\\nyou to do at present. I hope you will soon be able to employ yourself.\\r\\nWhat a happy thing it will be for you to be able, by and by, to read,\\r\\nand write and draw; then you will never be forced to sit idle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pains of idleness stimulate children to industry, if they are from\\r\\ntime to time properly contrasted with the pleasures of occupation. We\\r\\nshould associate cheerfulness, and praise, and looks of approbation,\\r\\nwith industry; and, whenever young people invent employments for\\r\\nthemselves, they should be assisted as much as possible, and\\r\\nencouraged. At that age when they are apt to grow tired in half an\\r\\nhour of their playthings, we had better give them playthings only for\\r\\na very short time, at intervals in the day; and, instead of waiting\\r\\ntill they are tired, we should take the things away before they are\\r\\nweary of them. Nor should we discourage the inquisitive genius from\\r\\nexamining into the structure of their toys, whatever they may be. The\\r\\nsame ingenious and active dispositions, which prompt these inquiries,\\r\\nwill secure children from all those numerous temptations to do\\r\\nmischief, to which the idle are exposed. Ingenious children are\\r\\npleased with contrivances which answer the purposes for which they are\\r\\nintended: and they feel sincere regret whenever these are injured or\\r\\ndestroyed: this we mention as a further comfort and security for\\r\\nparents, who, in the company of young mechanics, are apt to tremble\\r\\nfor their furniture. Children who observe, and who begin to amuse\\r\\nthemselves with _thought_, are not so actively hostile in their\\r\\nattacks upon inanimate objects. We were once present at the dissection\\r\\nof a wooden cuckoo, which was attended with extreme pleasure by a\\r\\nlarge family of children; and it was not one of the children who broke\\r\\nthe precious toy, but it was the father who took it to pieces. Nor was\\r\\nit the destruction of the plaything which entertained the company, but\\r\\nthe sight of the manner in which it was constructed. Many guesses were\\r\\nmade by all the spectators about the internal structure of the cuckoo,\\r\\nand the astonishment of the company was universal, when the bellows\\r\\nwere cut open, and the simple contrivance was revealed to view;\\r\\nprobably, more was learnt from this cuckoo, than was ever learnt from\\r\\nany cuckoo before. So far from being indifferent to the destruction of\\r\\nthis plaything, H---- the little girl of four years old, to whom it\\r\\nbelonged, remembered, several months afterwards, to remind her father\\r\\nof his promise to repair the mischief he had done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Several toys, which are made at present, are calculated to give\\r\\npleasure merely by exciting surprise, and of course give children\\'s\\r\\nminds such a tone, that they are afterwards too fond of _similar\\r\\nuseless baubles_.\"[3] This species of delight is soon over, and is\\r\\nsucceeded by a desire to triumph in the ignorance, the credulity, or\\r\\nthe cowardice, of their companions. Hence that propensity to play\\r\\ntricks, which is often injudiciously encouraged by the smiles of\\r\\nparents, who are apt to mistake it for a proof of wit and vivacity.\\r\\nThey forget, that \"gentle dulness ever loved a joke;\" and that even\\r\\nwit and vivacity, if they become troublesome and mischievous, will be\\r\\nfeared, and shunned. Many juggling tricks and puzzles are highly\\r\\ningenious; and, as far as they can exercise the invention or the\\r\\npatience of young people, they are useful. Care, however, should be\\r\\ntaken, to separate the ideas of deceit and of ingenuity, and to\\r\\nprevent children from glorying in the mere possession of a secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nToys which afford trials of dexterity and activity, such as tops,\\r\\nkites, hoops, balls, battledores and shuttlecocks, ninepins, and\\r\\ncup-and-ball, are excellent; and we see that they are consequently\\r\\ngreat and lasting favourites with children; their senses, their\\r\\nunderstanding, and their passions, are all agreeably interested and\\r\\nexercised by these amusements. They emulate each other; but, as some\\r\\nwill probably excel at one game, and some at another, this emulation\\r\\nwill not degenerate into envy. There is more danger that this hateful\\r\\npassion should be created in the minds of young competitors at those\\r\\ngames, where it is supposed that some _knack_ or _mystery_ is to be\\r\\nlearned before they can be played with success. Whenever children play\\r\\nat such games, we should point out to them how and why it is that they\\r\\nsucceed or fail: we may show them, that, in reality, there is no\\r\\n_knack_ or _mystery_ in any thing, but that from certain causes\\r\\ncertain effects will follow; that, after trying a number of\\r\\nexperiments, the circumstances essential to success may be discovered;\\r\\nand that all the ease and dexterity, which we often attribute to the\\r\\npower of natural genius, is simply the consequence of practice and\\r\\nindustry. This sober lesson may be taught to children without putting\\r\\nit into grave words or formal precepts. A gentleman once astonished a\\r\\nfamily of children by his dexterity in playing at bilboquet: he caught\\r\\nthe ball nine or ten times successively with great rapidity upon the\\r\\nspike: this success appeared miraculous; and the father, who observed\\r\\nthat it had made a great impression upon the little spectators, took\\r\\nthat opportunity to show the use of spinning the ball, to make the\\r\\nhole at the bottom ascend in a proper direction. The nature of\\r\\ncentrifugal motion, and its effect, in preserving the _parallelism_ of\\r\\n_motion_, if we may be allowed the expression, was explained, not at\\r\\nonce, but at different intervals, to the young audience. Only as much\\r\\nwas explained at a time as the children could understand, without\\r\\nfatiguing their attention, and the abstruse subject was made familiar\\r\\nby the mode of illustration that was adopted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is surprising how much children may learn from their playthings,\\r\\nwhen they are judiciously chosen, and when the habit of reflection and\\r\\nobservation is associated with the ideas of amusement and happiness. A\\r\\nlittle boy of nine years old, who had had a hoop to play with, asked\\r\\n\"why a hoop, or a plate, if rolled upon its edge, keeps up as long as\\r\\nit rolls, but falls as soon as it stops, and will not stand if you try\\r\\nto make it stand still upon its edge?\" Was not the boy\\'s understanding\\r\\nas well employed whilst he was thinking of this phenomenon, which he\\r\\nobserved whilst he was beating his hoop, as it could possibly have\\r\\nbeen by the most learned preceptor?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a pedantic schoolmaster sees a boy eagerly watching a paper kite,\\r\\nhe observes, \"What a pity it is that children cannot be made to mind\\r\\ntheir grammar as well as their kites!\" And he adds, perhaps, some\\r\\npeevish ejaculation on the natural idleness of boys, and that\\r\\npernicious love of play against which he is doomed to wage perpetual\\r\\nwar. A man of sense will see the same thing with a different eye; in\\r\\nthis pernicious love of play he will discern the symptoms of a love of\\r\\nscience, and, instead of deploring the natural idleness of children,\\r\\nhe will admire the activity which they display in the pursuit of\\r\\nknowledge. He will feel that it is his business to direct this\\r\\nactivity, to furnish his pupil with materials for fresh combinations,\\r\\nto put him or to let him put himself, in situations where he can make\\r\\nuseful observations, and acquire that experience which cannot be\\r\\nbought, and which no masters can communicate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will not be beneath the dignity of a philosophic tutor to consider\\r\\nthe different effects, which the most common plays of children have\\r\\nupon the habits of the understanding and temper. Whoever has watched\\r\\nchildren putting together a dissected map, must have been amused with\\r\\nthe trial between Wit and Judgment. The child, who quickly perceives\\r\\nresemblances, catches instantly at the first bit of the wooden map,\\r\\nthat has a single hook or hollow that seems likely to answer his\\r\\npurpose; he makes, perhaps, twenty different trials before he hits\\r\\nupon the right; whilst the wary youth, who has been accustomed to\\r\\nobserve differences, cautiously examines with his eye the whole\\r\\noutline before his hand begins to move; and, having exactly compared\\r\\nthe two indentures, he joins them with sober confidence, more proud of\\r\\nnever disgracing his judgment by a fruitless attempt, than ambitious\\r\\nof rapid success. He is slow, but sure, and wins the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some plays which require presence of mind, and which demand\\r\\nimmediate attention to what is actually going forward, in which\\r\\nchildren, capable of the greatest degree of abstract attention, are\\r\\nmost apt to be defective. They have many ideas, but none of them\\r\\nready, and their knowledge is useless, because it is recollected a\\r\\nmoment too late. Could we, in suitably dignified language, describe\\r\\nthe game of \"birds, beasts, and fishes,\" we should venture to\\r\\nprescribe it as no very painful remedy for these absent and abstracted\\r\\npersonages. When the handkerchief or the ball is thrown, and when his\\r\\nbird\\'s name is called for, the absent little philosopher is obliged to\\r\\ncollect his scattered thoughts instantaneously, or else he exposes\\r\\nhimself to the ridicule of naming, perhaps, a fish or a beast, or any\\r\\nbird but the right. To those children, who, on the contrary, are not\\r\\nsufficiently apt to abstract their attention, and who are what Bacon\\r\\ncalls \"birdwitted,\" we should recommend a solitary-board. At the\\r\\nsolitary-board they must withdraw their thoughts from all external\\r\\nobjects, hear nothing that is said, and fix their attention solely\\r\\nupon the figure and the pegs before them, else they will never\\r\\nsucceed; and, if they make one errour in their calculations, they lose\\r\\nall their labour. Those who are precipitate, and not sufficiently\\r\\nattentive to the consequences of their own actions, may receive many\\r\\nsalutary lessons at the draught or chess-board--happy, if they can\\r\\nlearn prudence and foresight, by frequently losing the battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are not quite so absurd as to imagine, that any great or permanent\\r\\neffects can be produced by such slight causes as a game at draughts,\\r\\nor at a solitary-board, but the combination of a number of apparent\\r\\ntrifles, is not to be neglected in education.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have never yet mentioned what will probably first occur to those\\r\\nwho would invent employments for children. We have never yet mentioned\\r\\na garden; we have never mentioned those great delights to children, a\\r\\nspade, a hoe, a rake, and a wheelbarrow. We hold all these in proper\\r\\nrespect; but we did not sooner mention them, because, if introduced\\r\\ntoo early, they are useless. We must not expect, that a boy six or\\r\\nseven years old, can find, for any length of time, sufficient daily\\r\\noccupation in a garden: he has not strength for hard labour; he can\\r\\ndig soft earth; he can weed groundsel, and other weeds, which take no\\r\\ndeep root in the earth; but after he has weeded his little garden, and\\r\\nsowed his seeds, there must be a suspension of his labours. Frequently\\r\\nchildren, for want of something to do, when they have sowed\\r\\nflower-seeds in their crooked beds, dig up the hopes of the year to\\r\\nmake a new walk, or to sink a well in their garden. We mention these\\r\\nthings, that parents may not be disappointed, or expect more from the\\r\\noccupation of a garden, than it can, at a very early age, afford. A\\r\\ngarden is an excellent resource for children, but they should have a\\r\\nvariety of other occupations: rainy days will come, and frost and\\r\\nsnow, and then children must be occupied within doors. We immediately\\r\\nthink of a little set of carpenter\\'s tools, to supply them with active\\r\\namusement. Boys will probably be more inclined to attempt making\\r\\nmodels, than drawings of the furniture which appears to be the most\\r\\neasy to imitate; they will imagine that, if they had but tools, they\\r\\ncould make boxes, and desks, and beds, and chests of drawers, and\\r\\ntables and chairs innumerable. But, alas! these fond imaginations are\\r\\ntoo soon dissipated. Suppose a boy of seven years old to be provided\\r\\nwith a small set of carpenter\\'s tools, his father thinks perhaps that\\r\\nhe has made him completely happy; but a week afterwards the father\\r\\nfinds dreadful marks of the file and saw upon his mahogany tables; the\\r\\nuse of these tools is immediately interdicted until a bench shall be\\r\\nprocured. Week after week passes away, till at length the frequently\\r\\nreiterated speech of \"Papa, you bid me put you in mind about my\\r\\nbench.\" \"Papa\" has its effect, and the bench appears. Now the young\\r\\ncarpenter thinks he is quite set up in the world, and projects carts\\r\\nand boxes, and reading-desks and writing-desks for himself and for his\\r\\nsisters, if he have any; but when he comes to the execution of his\\r\\nplans, what new difficulties, what new wants arise! the wood is too\\r\\nthick or too thin; it splits, or it cannot be cut with a knife; wire,\\r\\nnails, glue, and above all, the means of heating the glue, are\\r\\nwanting. At last some frail machine, stuck together with pegs or pins,\\r\\nis produced, and the workman is usually either too much ridiculed, or\\r\\ntoo much admired. The step from pegging to mortising is a very\\r\\ndifficult step, and the want of a mortising-chisel is insuperable: one\\r\\ntool is called upon to do the duty of another, and the pricker comes\\r\\nto an untimely end in doing the hard duty of the punch; the saw wants\\r\\nsetting; the plane will plane no longer; and the mallet must be used\\r\\ninstead of the hammer, because the hammer makes so much noise, that\\r\\nthe ladies of the family have voted for its being locked up. To all\\r\\nthese various evils the child submits in despair; and finding, after\\r\\nmany fruitless exertions, that he cannot make any of the fine things\\r\\nhe had projected, he throws aside his tools, and is deterred by these\\r\\ndisappointments from future industry and ingenuity. Such are the\\r\\nconsequences of putting excellent tools into the hands of children\\r\\nbefore they can possibly use them: but the tools which are useless at\\r\\nseven years old, will be a most valuable present at eleven or twelve,\\r\\nand for this age it will be prudent to reserve them. A rational\\r\\ntoy-shop should be provided with all manner of carpenter\\'s tools, with\\r\\nwood properly prepared for the young workman, and with screws, nails,\\r\\nglue, emery-paper, and a variety of articles which it would be tedious\\r\\nto enumerate; but which, if parents could readily meet within a\\r\\nconvenient assemblage, they would willingly purchase for their\\r\\nchildren. The trouble of hunting through a number of different shops,\\r\\nprevents them at present from purchasing such things; besides, they\\r\\nmay not perhaps be sufficiently good carpenters to know distinctly\\r\\nevery thing that is necessary for a young workman.\\r\\n\\r\\nCard, pasteboard, substantial but not sharp-pointed scissors, wire,\\r\\ngum and wax, may, in some degree, supply the want of carpenter\\'s tools\\r\\nat that early age when we have observed that the saw and plane are\\r\\nuseless. Models of common furniture should be made as toys, which\\r\\nshould take to pieces, so that all their parts, and the manner in\\r\\nwhich they are put together, might be seen distinctly; the names of\\r\\nthe different parts should be written[4] or stamped upon them: by\\r\\nthese means the names will be associated with realities; children will\\r\\nretain them in their memory, and they will neither learn by rote\\r\\ntechnical terms, nor will they be retarded in their progress in\\r\\nmechanical invention by the want of language. Before young people can\\r\\nuse tools, these models will amuse and exercise their attention. From\\r\\nmodels of furniture we may go on to models of architecture; pillars of\\r\\ndifferent orders, the roofs of houses, the manner of slating and\\r\\ntiling, &c. Then we may proceed to models of simple machines, choosing\\r\\nat first such as can be immediately useful to children in their own\\r\\namusements, such as wheelbarrows, carts, cranes, scales, steelyards,\\r\\njacks, and pumps, which children ever view with eager eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom simple, it will be easy to proceed gradually to models of more\\r\\ncomplicated, machinery: it would be tiresome to give a list of these;\\r\\nmodels of instruments used by manufacturers and artists should be\\r\\nseen; many of these are extremely ingenious; spinning-wheels, looms,\\r\\npaper-mills, wind-mills, water-mills, might with great advantage be\\r\\nshown in miniature to children.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe distracting noise and bustle, the multitude of objects which all\\r\\nclaim the attention at once, prevent young people from understanding\\r\\nmuch of what they see, when they are first taken to look at large\\r\\nmanufactories. If they had previously acquired some general idea of\\r\\nthe whole, and some particular knowledge of the different parts, they\\r\\nwould not stare when they get into these places; they would not \"stare\\r\\nround, see nothing, and come home content,\" bewildered by the sight of\\r\\ncogs and wheels; and the explanations of the workmen would not be all\\r\\njargon to them; they would understand some of the technical terms,\\r\\nwhich so much alarm the intellects of those who hear them for the\\r\\nfirst time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may exercise the ingenuity and judgment of children by these models\\r\\nof machines, by showing them first the thing to be done, and exciting\\r\\nthem to invent the best means of doing it; afterwards give the models\\r\\nas the reward for their ingenuity, and let them compare their own\\r\\ninventions with the contrivances actually in use amongst artificers;\\r\\nby these means, young people may be led to compare a variety of\\r\\ndifferent contrivances; they will discern what parts of a machine are\\r\\nsuperfluous, and what inadequate, and they will class particular\\r\\nobservations gradually under general principles. It may be thought,\\r\\nthat this will tend to give children only mechanical invention, or we\\r\\nshould call it, perhaps, the invention of machines; and those who do\\r\\nnot require this particular talent, will despise it as unnecessary in\\r\\nwhat are called the liberal professions. Without attempting to compare\\r\\nthe value of different intellectual talents, we may observe, that they\\r\\nare all in some measure dependent upon each other. Upon this subject\\r\\nwe shall enlarge more fully when we come to consider the method of\\r\\ncultivating the memory and invention.\\r\\n\\r\\nChemical toys will be more difficult to manage than mechanical,\\r\\nbecause the materials, requisite to try many chemical experiments, are\\r\\nsuch as cannot safely be put into the hands of children. But a list of\\r\\nexperiments, and of the things necessary to try them, might easily be\\r\\ndrawn out by a chemist who would condescend to such a task; and if\\r\\nthese materials, with proper directions, were to be found at a\\r\\nrational toy-shop, parents would not be afraid of burning or poisoning\\r\\ntheir children in the first chemical lessons. In some families, girls\\r\\nare taught the confectionary art; might not this be advantageously\\r\\nconnected with some knowledge of chemistry, and might not they be\\r\\nbetter taught than by Mrs. Raffeld or Mrs. Glass?[5] Every culinary\\r\\noperation may be performed as an art, probably, as well by a cook as\\r\\nby a chemist; but, if the chemist did not assist the cook now and then\\r\\nwith a little science, epicures would have great reason for\\r\\nlamentation. We do not, by any means, advise that girls should be\\r\\ninstructed in confectionary arts, at the hazard of their keeping\\r\\ncompany with servants. If they learn any thing of this sort, there\\r\\nwill be many precautions necessary to separate them from servants: we\\r\\ndo not advise that these hazards should be run; but if girls learn\\r\\nconfectionary, let them learn the principles of chemistry, which may\\r\\nassist in this art.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren are very fond of attempting experiments in dying, and are\\r\\nvery curious about vegetable dyes; but they can seldom proceed for\\r\\nwant of the means of boiling, evaporating, distilling, and subliming.\\r\\nSmall stills, and small tea-kettles and lamps, would be extremely\\r\\nuseful to them: these might be used in the room with the children\\'s\\r\\nparents, which would prevent all danger: they should continue to be\\r\\nthe property of the parents, and should be produced only when they are\\r\\nwanted. No great apparatus is necessary for showing children the first\\r\\nsimple operations in chemistry: such as evaporation, crystalization,\\r\\ncalcination, detonation, effervescence, and saturation. Water and\\r\\nfire, salt and sugar, lime and vinegar, are not very difficult to be\\r\\nprocured; and a wine-glass is to be found in every house. The\\r\\ndifference between an acid and alkali should be early taught to\\r\\nchildren; many grown people begin to learn chemistry, without\\r\\ndistinctly knowing what is meant by those terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the selection of chemical experiments for young people, it will be\\r\\nbest to avoid such as have the appearance of jugglers tricks, as it is\\r\\nnot our purpose to excite the amazement of children for the moment,\\r\\nbut to give them a permanent taste for science. In a well known book,\\r\\ncalled \"Hooper\\'s _Rational Recreations_,\" there are many ingenious\\r\\nexperiments; but through the whole work there is such a want of an\\r\\nenlarged mind, and such a love of magic and deception appears, as must\\r\\nrender it not only useless, but unsafe, for young people, in its\\r\\npresent state. Perhaps a selection might be made from it in which\\r\\nthese defects might be avoided: such titles as \"_The real apparition:\\r\\nthe confederate counters: the five beatitudes_: and _the book of\\r\\nfate_,\" may be changed for others more _rational_. Receipts for\\r\\n\"_Changing winter into spring_,\" for making \"_Self-raising pyramids,\\r\\ninchanted mirrors_, and _intelligent flies_,\" might be omitted, or\\r\\nexplained to advantage. Recreation the 5th, \"To tell by the dial of a\\r\\nwatch at what hour any person intends to rise;\" Recreation the 12th,\\r\\n\"To produce the appearance of a phantom on a pedestal placed on the\\r\\nmiddle of a table;\" and Recreation the 30th, \"To write several letters\\r\\nwhich contain no meaning, upon cards; to make them, after they have\\r\\nbeen twice shuffled, give an answer to a question that shall be\\r\\nproposed;\" as for example, \"What is love?\" scarcely come under the\\r\\ndenomination of Rational Recreations, nor will they much conduce to\\r\\nthe end proposed in the introduction to Hooper\\'s work; that is to say,\\r\\nin his own words, \"To enlarge and fortify the mind of man, that he may\\r\\nadvance with tranquil steps through the flowery paths of\\r\\ninvestigation, till arriving at some noble eminence, he beholds, with\\r\\nawful astonishment, the boundless regions of science, and becomes\\r\\nanimated to attain a still more lofty station, whilst his heart is\\r\\nincessantly rapt with joys of which the groveling herd have no\\r\\nconception.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEven in those chemical experiments in this book, which are really\\r\\ningenious and entertaining, we should avoid giving the old absurd\\r\\ntitles, which can only confuse the understanding, and spoil the taste\\r\\nof children. The tree of Diana, and \"Philosophic wool,\" are of this\\r\\nspecies. It is not necessary to make every thing marvellous and\\r\\nmagical, to fix the attention of young people; if they are properly\\r\\neducated, they will find more amusement in discovering, or in\\r\\nsearching for the cause of the effects which they see, than in a blind\\r\\nadmiration of the juggler\\'s tricks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the papers of the Manchester Society, in Franklin\\'s letters, in\\r\\nPriestley\\'s and Percival\\'s works, there may be found a variety of\\r\\nsimple experiments which require no great apparatus, and which will at\\r\\nonce amuse and instruct. All the papers of the Manchester Society,\\r\\nupon the repulsion and attraction of oil and water, are particularly\\r\\nsuited to children, because they state a variety of simple facts; the\\r\\nmind is led to reason upon them, and induced to judge of the different\\r\\nconclusions which are drawn from them by different people. The names\\r\\nof Dr. Percival, or Dr. Wall, will have no weight with children; they\\r\\nwill compare only the reasons and experiments. Oil and water, a cork,\\r\\na needle, a plate, and a glass tumbler, are all the things necessary\\r\\nfor these experiments. Mr. Henry\\'s experiments upon the influence that\\r\\nfixed air has on vegetation, and several of Reaumur\\'s experiments,\\r\\nmentioned in the memoirs of the French Academy of Sciences, are\\r\\ncalculated to please young people much, and can be repeated without\\r\\nexpense or difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo those who acquire habits of observation, every thing that is to be\\r\\nseen or heard, becomes a source of amusement. Natural history\\r\\ninterests children at an early age; but their curiosity and activity\\r\\nis often repressed and restrained by the ignorance or indolence of\\r\\ntheir tutors. The most inquisitive genius grows tired of repeating,\\r\\n\"Pray look at this--What is it? What can the use of this be?\" when the\\r\\nconstant answer is, \"Oh! it\\'s nothing worth looking at, throw it away,\\r\\nit will dirty the house.\" Those who have attended to the ways of\\r\\nchildren and parents, well know that there are many little\\r\\ninconveniences attending their amusements, which the sublime eye of\\r\\nthe theorist in education overlooks, which, nevertheless, are\\r\\nessential to practical success. \"It will dirty the house,\" puts a stop\\r\\nto many of the operations of the young philosopher; nor is it\\r\\nreasonable that his experiments should interfere with the necessary\\r\\nregularity of a well ordered family. But most well ordered families\\r\\nallow their horses and their dogs to have houses to themselves; cannot\\r\\none room be allotted to the children of the family? If they are to\\r\\nlearn chemistry, mineralogy, botany, or mechanics; if they are to take\\r\\nsufficient bodily exercise without tormenting the whole family with\\r\\nnoise, a room should be provided for them. We mention exercise and\\r\\nnoise in particular, because we think they will, to many, appear of\\r\\nthe most importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo direct children in their choice of fossils, and to give them some\\r\\nidea of the general arrangements of mineralogy, toy-shops should be\\r\\nprovided with specimens of ores, &c. properly labelled and arranged,\\r\\nin drawers, so that they may be kept in order. Children should have\\r\\nempty shelves in their cabinets, to be filled with their own\\r\\ncollections; they will then know how to direct their researches, and\\r\\nhow to dispose of their treasures. If they have proper places to keep\\r\\nthings in, they will acquire a taste for order by the best means, by\\r\\nfeeling the use of it: to either sex, this taste will be highly\\r\\nadvantageous. Children who are active and industrious, and who have a\\r\\ntaste for natural history, often collect, with much enthusiasm, a\\r\\nvariety of pebbles and common stones, which they value as great\\r\\ncuriosities, till some surly mineralogist happens to see them, and\\r\\ncondemns them all with one supercilious \"pshaw!\" or else a journey is\\r\\nto be taken, and there is no way in making up the heterogeneous,\\r\\ncumbersome collection, which must, of course, be abandoned. Nay, if no\\r\\njourney is to be taken, a visitor, perhaps, comes unexpectedly; the\\r\\nlittle naturalist\\'s apartment must be vacated on a few minutes notice,\\r\\nand the labour of years falls a sacrifice, in an instant, to the\\r\\nhousemaid\\'s undistinguishing broom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may seem trifling to insist so much upon such slight things, but,\\r\\nin fact, nothing can be done in education without attention to minute\\r\\ncircumstances. Many who have genius to sketch large plans, have seldom\\r\\npatience to attend to the detail which is necessary for their\\r\\naccomplishment. This is a useful, and therefore, no humiliating\\r\\ndrudgery.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the little cabinets, which we have mentioned, should be sold\\r\\ncheap microscopes, which will unfold a world of new delights to\\r\\nchildren; and it is very probable that children will not only be\\r\\nentertained with looking at objects through a microscope, but they\\r\\nwill consider the nature of the magnifying glass. They should not be\\r\\nrebuffed with the answer, \"Oh, it\\'s only a common magnifying glass,\"\\r\\nbut they should be encouraged in their laudable curiosity; they may\\r\\neasily be led to try slight experiments in optics, which will, at\\r\\nleast, give the habits of observation and attention. In Dr.\\r\\nPriestley\\'s History of Vision, many experiments may be found, which\\r\\nare not above the comprehension of children of ten or eleven years\\r\\nold; we do not imagine that any science can be taught by desultory\\r\\nexperiments, but we think that a taste for science may early be given\\r\\nby making it entertaining, and by exciting young people to exercise\\r\\ntheir reasoning and inventive faculties upon every object which\\r\\nsurrounds them. We may point out that great discoveries have often\\r\\nbeen made by attention to slight circumstances. The blowing of soap\\r\\nbubbles, as it was first performed as a scientific experiment by the\\r\\ncelebrated Dr. Hook, before the Royal Society, makes a conspicuous\\r\\nfigure in Dr. Priestley\\'s chapter on the reflection of light; this may\\r\\nbe read to children, and they will be pleased when they observe that\\r\\nwhat at first appeared only a trifling amusement, has occupied the\\r\\nunderstanding, and excited the admiration, of some great philosophers.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery child observes the colours which are to be seen in panes of\\r\\nglass windows: in Priestley\\'s History of Vision, there are some\\r\\nexperiments of Hook\\'s and Lord Brereton\\'s upon these colours, which\\r\\nmay be selected. Buffon\\'s observations upon blue and green shadows,\\r\\nare to be found in the same work, and they are very entertaining. In\\r\\nDr. Franklin\\'s letters, there are numerous experiments, which are\\r\\nparticularly suited to young people; especially, as in every instance\\r\\nhe speaks with that candour and openness to conviction, and with that\\r\\npatient desire to discover truth, which we should wish our pupils to\\r\\nadmire and imitate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of the experiments which have been tried in the progress\\r\\nof any science, and of the manner in which observations of minute\\r\\nfacts have led to great discoveries, will be useful to the\\r\\nunderstanding, and will gradually make the mind expert in that mental\\r\\nalgebra, on which both reasoning and invention (which is, perhaps,\\r\\nonly a more rapid species of reasoning) depend. In drawing out a list\\r\\nof experiments for children, it will, therefore, be advantageous to\\r\\nplace them in that order which will best exhibit their relative\\r\\nconnection; and, instead of showing young people the steps of a\\r\\ndiscovery, we should frequently pause to try if they can invent. In\\r\\nthis, our pupils will succeed often beyond our expectations; and,\\r\\nwhether it be in mechanics, chemistry, geometry, or in the arts, the\\r\\nsame course of education will be found to have the same advantages.\\r\\nWhen the powers of reason have been cultivated, and the inventive\\r\\nfaculty exercised; when general habits of voluntary exertion and\\r\\npatient perseverance, have been acquired, it will be easy, either for\\r\\nthe pupil himself, or for his friends, to direct his abilities to\\r\\nwhatever is necessary for his happiness. We do not use the phrase,\\r\\n_success in the world_, because, if it conveys any distinct ideas, it\\r\\nimplies some which are, perhaps, inconsistent with real happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst our pupils occupy and amuse themselves with observation,\\r\\nexperiment, and invention, we must take care that they have a\\r\\nsufficient variety of manual and bodily exercises. A turning-lathe,\\r\\nand a work-bench, will afford them constant active employment; and\\r\\nwhen young people can invent, they feel great pleasure in the\\r\\nexecution of their own plans. We do not speak from vague theory; we\\r\\nhave seen the daily pleasures of the work-bench, and the persevering\\r\\neagerness with which young people work in wood, and brass, and iron,\\r\\nwhen tools are put into their hands at a proper age, and when their\\r\\nunderstanding has been previously taught the simple principles of\\r\\nmechanics. It is not to be expected that any exhortations we could\\r\\nuse, could prevail upon a father, who happens to have no taste for\\r\\nmechanics, or for chemistry, to spend any of his time in his\\r\\nchildren\\'s laboratory, or at their work-bench; but in his choice of a\\r\\ntutor, he may perhaps supply his own defects; and he will consider,\\r\\nthat even by interesting himself in the daily occupations of his\\r\\nchildren, he will do more in the advancement of their education, than\\r\\ncan be done by paying money to a hundred masters.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not mean to confine young people to the laboratory or the\\r\\nwork-bench, for exercise; the more varied exercises, the better. Upon\\r\\nthis subject we shall speak more fully hereafter: we have in general\\r\\nrecommended all trials of address and dexterity, except games of\\r\\nchance, which we think should be avoided, as they tend to give a taste\\r\\nfor gambling; a passion, which has been the ruin of so many young men\\r\\nof promising talents, of so many once happy families, that every\\r\\nparent will think it well worth his while to attend to the smallest\\r\\ncircumstances in education, which can prevent its seizing hold of the\\r\\nminds of his children.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn children, as in men, a taste for gaming arises from the want of\\r\\nbetter occupation, or of proper emotion to relieve them from the pains\\r\\nand penalties of idleness; both the vain and indolent are prone to\\r\\nthis taste from different causes. The idea of personal merit is\\r\\ninsensibly connected with what is called _good luck_, and before\\r\\navarice absorbs every other feeling, vanity forms no inconsiderable\\r\\npart of the charm which fixes such numbers to the gaming-table.\\r\\nIndolent persons are fond of games of chance, because they feel\\r\\nthemselves roused agreeably from their habitual state of apathy, or\\r\\nbecause they perceive, that at these contests, without any mental\\r\\nexertion, they are equal, perhaps superior, to their competitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy they, who have early been inspired with a taste for science and\\r\\nliterature! They will have a constant succession of agreeable ideas;\\r\\nthey will find endless variety in the commonest objects which surround\\r\\nthem; and feeling that every day of their lives they have sufficient\\r\\namusement, they will require no extraordinary excitations, no holyday\\r\\npleasures. They who have learnt, from their own experience, a just\\r\\nconfidence in their own powers; they who have tasted the delights of\\r\\nwell-earned praise, will not lightly trust to _chance_, for the\\r\\nincrease of self-approbation; nor will those pursue, with too much\\r\\neagerness, the precarious triumphs of fortune, who know, that in their\\r\\nusual pursuits, it is in their own power to command success\\r\\nproportioned to their exertions. Perhaps it may be thought, that we\\r\\nshould have deferred our eulogium upon literature till we came to\\r\\nspeak of Tasks; but if there usually appears but little connection in\\r\\na child\\'s mind, between books and toys, this must be attributed to his\\r\\nhaving had bad books and bad toys. In the hands of a judicious\\r\\ninstructer, no means are too small to be useful; every thing is made\\r\\nconducive to his purposes, and instead of useless baubles, his pupils\\r\\nwill be provided with play things which may instruct, and with\\r\\noccupations which may at once amuse and improve the understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be superfluous to give a greater variety of instances of the\\r\\nsorts of amusements which are advantageous; we fear that we have\\r\\nalready given too many, and that we have hazarded some observations,\\r\\nwhich will be thought too pompous for a chapter upon Toys. We intended\\r\\nto have added to this chapter an inventory of the present most\\r\\nfashionable articles in our toy-shops, and _a list of the new\\r\\nassortment_, to speak in the true style of an advertisement; but we\\r\\nare obliged to defer this for the present; upon a future occasion we\\r\\nshall submit it to the judgment of the public. A revolution, _even in\\r\\ntoy-shops_, should not be attempted, unless there appear a moral\\r\\ncertainty that we both may, and can, change for the better. The danger\\r\\nof doing too much in education, is greater even than the danger of\\r\\ndoing too little. As the merchants in France answered to Colbert, when\\r\\nhe desired to know \"how he could best assist them,\" children might,\\r\\nperhaps, reply to those who are most officious to amuse them, \"Leave\\r\\nus to ourselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] Dr. Fothergill.\\r\\n\\r\\n[3] Dr. Beddoes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[4] We are indebted to Dr. Beddoes for this idea.\\r\\n\\r\\n[5] We do not mean to do injustice to Mrs. Raffeld\\'s professional\\r\\nskill.\\r\\n\\r\\n[6] V. Diderot\\'s ingenious preface to \"Chymie de gout et de l\\'odorat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\nTASKS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why don\\'t you get your task, instead of playing with your playthings\\r\\nfrom morning till night? You are grown too old now to do nothing but\\r\\nplay. It is high time you should learn to read and write, for you\\r\\ncannot be a child all your life, child; so go and fetch your _book_,\\r\\nand learn your _task_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis angry apostrophe is probably addressed to a child, at the moment\\r\\nwhen he is intent upon some agreeable occupation, which is now to be\\r\\nstigmatized with the name of Play. Why that word should all at once\\r\\nchange its meaning; why that should now be a crime, which was formerly\\r\\na virtue; why he, who had so often been desired to _go and play_,\\r\\nshould now be reviled for his obedience, the young casuist is unable\\r\\nto discover. He hears that he is no longer a child: this he is willing\\r\\nto believe; but the consequence is alarming. Of the new duties\\r\\nincumbent upon his situation, he has but yet a confused idea. In his\\r\\nmanly character, he is not yet thoroughly perfect: his pride would\\r\\nmake him despise every thing that is childish, but no change has yet\\r\\nbeen wrought in the inward man, and his old tastes and new ambition,\\r\\nare in direct opposition. Whether to learn to read, be a dreadful\\r\\nthing or not, is a question he cannot immediately solve; but if his\\r\\nreasoning faculty be suspended, there is yet a power secretly working\\r\\nwithin him, by which he will involuntarily be governed. This power is\\r\\nthe power of association: of its laws, he is, probably, not more\\r\\nignorant than his tutor; nor is he aware that whatever word or idea\\r\\ncomes into his mind, with any species of pain, will return, whenever\\r\\nit is recalled to his memory, with the same feelings. The word Task,\\r\\nthe first time he hears it, is an unmeaning word, but it ceases to be\\r\\nindifferent to him the moment he hears it pronounced in a terrible\\r\\nvoice. \"Learn your task,\" and \"fetch your book,\" recur to his\\r\\nrecollection with indistinct feelings of pain; and hence, without\\r\\nfurther consideration, he will be disposed to dislike both books and\\r\\ntasks; but his feelings are the last things to be considered upon this\\r\\noccasion; the immediate business, is to teach him to read. A new era\\r\\nin his life now commences. The age of learning begins, and begins in\\r\\nsorrow. The consequences of a bad beginning, are proverbially ominous;\\r\\nbut no omens can avert his fate, no omens can deter his tutor from the\\r\\nundertaking; the appointed moment is come; the boy is four years old,\\r\\nand he must learn to read. Some people, struck with a panic fear, lest\\r\\ntheir children should never learn to read and write, think that they\\r\\ncannot be in too great a hurry to teach them. Spelling-books,\\r\\ngrammars, dictionaries, rods and masters, are collected; nothing is to\\r\\nbe heard of in the house but tasks; nothing is to be seen but tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No tears! no tasks! no masters! nothing upon compulsion!\" say the\\r\\nopposite party in education. \"Children must be left entirely at\\r\\nliberty; they will learn every thing better than you can teach them;\\r\\ntheir memory must not be overloaded with trash; their reason must be\\r\\nleft to grow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir reason will never grow, unless it be exercised, is the reply;\\r\\ntheir memory must be stored whilst they are young, because, in youth,\\r\\nthe memory is most tenacious. If you leave them at liberty for ever,\\r\\nthey will never learn to spell; they will never learn Latin; they will\\r\\nnever learn Latin grammar; yet, they must learn Latin grammar, and a\\r\\nnumber of other disagreeable things; therefore, we must give them\\r\\ntasks and task-masters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all these assertions, perhaps, we shall find a mixture of truth\\r\\nand errour; therefore, we had better be governed by neither party, but\\r\\nlisten to both, and examine arguments unawed by authority. And first,\\r\\nas to the panic fear, which, though no argument, is a most powerful\\r\\nmotive. We see but few examples of children so extremely stupid as not\\r\\nto have been able to learn to read and write between the years of\\r\\nthree and thirteen; but we see many whose temper and whose\\r\\nunderstanding have been materially injured by premature or injudicious\\r\\ninstruction; we see many who are disgusted, perhaps irrecoverably,\\r\\nwith literature, whilst they are fluently reading books which they\\r\\ncannot comprehend, or learning words by rote, to which they affix no\\r\\nideas. It is scarcely worth while to speak of the vain ambition of\\r\\nthose who long only to have it said, that their children read sooner\\r\\nthan those of their neighbours do; for, supposing their utmost wish to\\r\\nbe gratified, that their son could read before the age when children\\r\\ncommonly articulate, still the triumph must be of short duration, the\\r\\nfame confined to a small circle of \"foes and friends,\" and, probably,\\r\\nin a few years, the memory of the phenomenon would remain only with\\r\\nhis doting grandmother. Surely, it is the use which children make of\\r\\ntheir acquirements which is of consequence, not the possessing them a\\r\\nfew years sooner or later. A man, who, during his whole life, could\\r\\nnever write any thing that was worth reading, would find it but poor\\r\\nconsolation for himself, his friends, or the public, to reflect, that\\r\\nhe had been in joining-hand before he was five years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it is usually managed, it is a dreadful task indeed to learn, and,\\r\\nif possible, a more dreadful task to teach to read. With the help of\\r\\ncounters, and coaxing, and gingerbread, or by dint of reiterated pain\\r\\nand terror, the names of the four-and-twenty letters of the alphabet,\\r\\nare, perhaps, in the course of some weeks, firmly fixed in the pupil\\'s\\r\\nmemory. So much the worse; all these names will disturb him, if he\\r\\nhave common sense, and at every step must stop his progress. To begin\\r\\nwith the vowels: each of these have several different sounds, and,\\r\\nconsequently, ought to have several names, or different signs, to\\r\\ndistinguish them in different circumstances. In the first lesson of\\r\\nthe spelling book, the child begins with a-b, makes ab; b-a makes ba.\\r\\nThe inference, if any general inference can be drawn from this lesson,\\r\\nis, that when _a_ comes before _b_, it has one sound, and after _b_,\\r\\nit has another sound; but this is contradicted by and by, and it\\r\\nappears that _a_ after _b_, has various sounds, as in _ball_, in\\r\\n_bat_, in _bare_. The letter _i_ in _fire_, is _i_, as we call it in\\r\\nthe alphabet, but in fir, it is changed; in _pin_, it is changed\\r\\nagain; so that the child, being ordered to affix to the same sign a\\r\\nvariety of sounds and names, and not knowing in what circumstances to\\r\\nobey, and in what to disregard the contradictory injunctions imposed\\r\\nupon him, he pronounces sounds at hazard, and adheres positively to\\r\\nthe last ruled case, or maintains an apparently sullen, or truly\\r\\nphilosophic and sceptical silence. Must _e_ in _pen_, and _e_ in\\r\\n_where_, and _e_ in _verse_, and _e_ in _fear_, all be called _e_\\r\\nalike? The child is patted on the head for reading _u_ as it ought to\\r\\nbe pronounced in _future_; but if, remembering this encouragement, the\\r\\npupil should venture to pronounce _u_ in _gun_, and _bun_, in the same\\r\\nmanner, he will, inevitably, be disgraced. Pain and shame, impress\\r\\nprecepts upon the mind: the child, therefore, is intent upon\\r\\nremembering the new sound of _u_ in _bun_; but when he comes to\\r\\n_busy_, and _burial_, and _prudence_, his last precedent will lead him\\r\\nfatally astray, and he will again be called a _dunce_. _O_, in the\\r\\nexclamation _Oh!_ is happily called by its alphabetical name; but in\\r\\n_to_, we can hardly know it again, and in _morning_ and _wonder_, it\\r\\nhas a third and a fourth additional sound. The amphibious letter _y_,\\r\\nwhich is either a vowel or a consonant, has one sound in one\\r\\ncharacter, and two sounds in the other; as a consonant, it is\\r\\npronounced as in _yesterday_; in _try_, it is sounded as _i_; in\\r\\n_any_, and in the termination of many other words, it is sounded like\\r\\n_e_. Must a child know all this by intuition, or must it be whipt into\\r\\nhim? But he must know a great deal more, before he can read the most\\r\\ncommon words. What length of time should we allow him for learning,\\r\\nwhen _c_ is to be sounded like _k_, and when like _s_? and how much\\r\\nlonger time shall we add for learning, when _s_ shall be pronounced\\r\\n_sh_, as in _sure_, or _z_, as in _has_; the sound of which last\\r\\nletter _z_, he cannot, by any conjuration, obtain from the name _zed_,\\r\\nthe only name by which he has been taught to call it? How much time\\r\\nshall we allow a patient tutor for teaching a docile pupil, when _g_\\r\\nis to be sounded soft, and when hard? There are many carefully worded\\r\\nrules in the spelling-books, specifying before what letters, and in\\r\\nwhat situations, _g_ shall vary in sound; but, unfortunately, these\\r\\nrules are difficult to be learned by heart, and still more difficult\\r\\nto understand. These laws, however positive, are not found to be of\\r\\nuniversal application, or at least, a child has not always wit or time\\r\\nto apply them upon the spur of the occasion. In coming to the words\\r\\n_ingenious gentleman, get a good grammar_, he may be puzzled by the\\r\\nnice distinctions he is to make in pronunciation in cases apparently\\r\\nsimilar; but he has not yet become acquainted with all the powers of\\r\\nthis privileged letter: in company with _h_, it assumes the character\\r\\nof _f_, as in _tough_; another time he meets it, perhaps, in the same\\r\\ncompany, in the same place, and, as nearly as possible, in the same\\r\\ncircumstances, as in the word _though_; but now _g_ is to become a\\r\\nsilent letter, and is to pass incognito, and the child will commit an\\r\\nunpardonable errour, if he claimed the incognito as his late\\r\\nacquaintance _f_. Still, all these are slight difficulties; a moment\\'s\\r\\nreflection must convince us, that by teaching the common names of\\r\\nevery consonant in the alphabet, we prepare a child for misery, when\\r\\nhe begins to spell or read. A consonant, as sayeth the spelling-book,\\r\\nis a letter which cannot be pronounced without a vowel before or after\\r\\nit: for this reason, _B_, is called _be_, and _L_, _el_; but why the\\r\\nvowel should come first in the one case, or last in the second, we are\\r\\nnot informed; nor are we told why the names of some letters have no\\r\\nresemblance whatever to their sounds, either with a vowel before or\\r\\nafter them. Suppose, that after having learned the alphabet, a child\\r\\nwas to read the words\\r\\n\\r\\n    _Here is some apple-pye._\\r\\n    He would pronounce the letters thus:\\r\\n    _Acheare ies esoeme apepeele pewie._\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this pronunciation the child would never decipher these simple\\r\\nwords. It will be answered, perhaps, that no child is expected to read\\r\\nas soon as he has learnt his alphabet: a long initiation of\\r\\nmonosyllabic, dissyllabic, trissyllabic, and polysyllabic words is\\r\\npreviously to be submitted to; nor, after this inauguration, are the\\r\\nnovices capable of performing with propriety the ceremony of reading\\r\\nwhole words and sentences. By a different method of teaching, all this\\r\\nwaste of labour and of time, all this confusion of rules and\\r\\nexceptions, and all the consequent confusion in the understanding of\\r\\nthe pupil, may be avoided.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn teaching a child to read, every letter should have a precise single\\r\\nsound annexed to its figure; this should never vary. Where two\\r\\nconsonants are joined together, so as to have but one sound, as ph,\\r\\nsh, &c. the two letters should be coupled together by a distinct\\r\\ninvariable mark. Letters that are silent should be marked in such a\\r\\nmanner as to point out to the child that they are not to be sounded.\\r\\nUpon these simple rules our method of teaching to read has been\\r\\nfounded. The signs or marks, by which these distinctions are to be\\r\\neffected, are arbitrary, and may be varied as the teacher chooses; the\\r\\naddition of a single point above or below the common letters is\\r\\nemployed to distinguish the different sounds that are given to the\\r\\nsame letter, and a mark underneath such letters as are to be omitted,\\r\\nis the only apparatus necessary. These marks were employed by the\\r\\nauthor in 1776, before he had seen Sheridan\\'s, or any similar\\r\\ndictionary; he has found that they do not confuse children as much as\\r\\nfigures, because when dots are used to distinguish sounds, there is\\r\\nonly a change of place, and no change of form: but any person that\\r\\nchooses it, may substitute figures instead of dots. It should,\\r\\nhowever, be remembered, that children must learn to distinguish the\\r\\nfigures before they can be useful in discriminating the words.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these sounds, and each of the characters which denote them, should\\r\\nbe distinctly known by a child before we begin to teach him to read.\\r\\nAnd here at the first step we must entreat the teacher to have\\r\\npatience; to fix firmly in her mind, we say _her_ mind, because we\\r\\naddress ourselves to mothers; that it is immaterial whether a child\\r\\nlearns this alphabet in six weeks or in six months; at all events, let\\r\\nit not be inculcated with restraint, or made tiresome, lest it should\\r\\nretard the whole future progress of the pupil. We do not mean to\\r\\nrecommend the custom of teaching in play, but surely a cheerful\\r\\ncountenance is not incompatible with application.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three sounds of the letter (a) should first be taught; they may be\\r\\nlearned by the dullest child in a week, if the letters are shown to\\r\\nhim for a minute or two, twice a day. Proper moments should be chosen\\r\\nwhen the child is not intent upon any thing else; when other children\\r\\nhave appeared to be amused with reading; when the pupil himself\\r\\nappears anxious to be instructed. As soon as he is acquainted with the\\r\\nsounds of (_a_) and with their distinguishing marks, each of these\\r\\nsounds should be formed into syllables, with each of the consonants;\\r\\nbut we should never name the consonants by their usual names; if it\\r\\nbe required to point them out by sounds, let them resemble the real\\r\\nsounds or powers of the consonants; but in fact it will never be\\r\\n_necessary_ to name the consonants separately, till their powers, in\\r\\ncombination with the different vowels, be distinctly acquired. It will\\r\\nthen be time enough to teach the common names of the letters. To a\\r\\nperson unacquainted with the principles upon which this mode of\\r\\nteaching is founded, it must appear strange, that a child should be\\r\\nable to read before he knows the names of his letters; but it has been\\r\\nascertained, that the names of the letters are an incumbrance in\\r\\nteaching a child to read.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Vowels.        | Dipthongs.       | Consonants.\\r\\n                 |                  |\\r\\n  Sounded as in  | Sounded as in    | & double Consonants\\r\\n                 |                  |\\r\\n                 |                  |\\r\\n  a       fate   | [=ea]     ocean  | c as in     cap\\r\\n  [.a]    fat    |                  | [c.]        city\\r\\n  [.a.]   fall   | [=ew]     few    | [=ch]       child\\r\\n  e       mere   |                  | [=ch.]      machine\\r\\n  [.e]    met    | [=ia]     filial | g           got\\r\\n  [e.]    her    |                  | [.g]        age\\r\\n  [.e.]   where  | [=ie]     Daniel | [=ng]       long\\r\\n  i       fine   |                  | ing         thing\\r\\n  [.i]    in     | [=io]     minion | [=le]       able\\r\\n  [i.]    bird   |                  | [=re]       acre\\r\\n  [.i.]   machine| [=oi]     voice  | [=ph]       physic\\r\\n  o       throne |                  | [.s]        has\\r\\n  [.o]    on     | [=ou]     found  | [=sh]       she\\r\\n  [o.]    love   |                  | [=sion]     fusion\\r\\n  [..o]   move   | [=ow]     now    | [=th]       the\\r\\n  u       pure   |                  | ti          christian\\r\\n  [\\xc3\\xbc]     busy   | [ua]      assuage| [=tion]     nation\\r\\n  [u.]    sun    |                  | [=wh]       who\\r\\n  [..u]   full   | [=ui]     languid| [=ough]     tough\\r\\n  [.y]    by     |                  |\\r\\n  [:y]    ably   | [=oy]     joy    |\\r\\n\\r\\n  Consonants\\r\\n\\r\\n  ba ca da fa ga ha ja ka la ma\\r\\n  na pa qua ra sa ta va wa ya za\\r\\n\\r\\n  (`) _This mark under a Letter shews that it is not to be\\r\\n  pronounced, as_ [.e.]ight _in which_ igh _are not\\r\\n  sounded._\\r\\n\\r\\n  [Transcriber\\'s Note: The symbols in this table are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n  [.a] indicates dot above letter\\r\\n  [a.] indicates dot below letter\\r\\n  [.a.] indicates dot above letter and below letter\\r\\n  [..o] indicates dot in center of letter\\r\\n  [:a] indicates two dots above letter\\r\\n  [=ea] indicates a horizontal line through letters\\r\\n  [=ch.] indicates a horizontal line through letters and a dot below]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the quotation from Mrs. Barbauld, at the bottom of the alphabetical\\r\\ntables, there is a stroke between the letters _b_ and _r_ in\\r\\n_February_, and between _t_ and _h_, in _there_, to show that these\\r\\nletters are to be sounded together, so as to make one sound. The same\\r\\nis to be observed as to (_ng_) in the word _long_, and also as to the\\r\\nsyllable _ing_, which, in the table No. 4, column 4, is directed to be\\r\\ntaught as one sound. The mark (.) of obliteration, is put under (_y_)\\r\\nin the word _days_, under _e_ final in _there_, and also under one of\\r\\nthe _l_\\'s and the (_w_) in _yellow_, to show that these letters are\\r\\nnot to be pronounced. The exceptions to this scheme of articulation\\r\\nare very few; such as occur, are marked, with the number employed in\\r\\nWalker\\'s dictionary, to denote the exception, to which excellent work,\\r\\nthe teacher will, of course, refer.\\r\\n\\r\\nParents, at the first sight of this new alphabet, will perhaps tremble\\r\\nlest they should be obliged to learn the whole of it before they begin\\r\\nto teach their children: but they may calm their apprehensions, for\\r\\nthey need only point out the letters in succession to the child, and\\r\\nsound them as they are sounded in the words annexed to the letters in\\r\\nthe table, and the child will soon, by repetition, render the marks of\\r\\nthe respective letters familiar to the teacher. We have never found\\r\\nany body complain of difficulty, who has gone on from letter to\\r\\nletter along with the child who was taught.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as our pupil knows the different sounds of (_a_) combined in\\r\\nsuccession with all the consonants, we may teach him the rest of the\\r\\nvowels joined with all the consonants, which will be a short and easy\\r\\nwork. Our readers need not be alarmed at the apparent slowness of this\\r\\nmethod: six months, at the rate of four or five minutes each day, will\\r\\nrender all these combinations perfectly familiar. One of Mrs.\\r\\nBarbauld\\'s lessons for young children, carefully marked in the same\\r\\nmanner as the alphabet, should, when they are well acquainted with the\\r\\nsounds of each of the vowels with each of the consonants, be put into\\r\\nour pupil\\'s hands.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sound of three or four letters together, will immediately become\\r\\nfamiliar to him; and when any of the less common sounds of the vowels,\\r\\nsuch as are contained in the second table, and the terminating sounds,\\r\\n_tion_, _ly_, &c. occur, they should be read to the child, and should\\r\\nbe added to what he has got by rote from time to time. When all these\\r\\nmarks and their corresponding sounds are learnt, the primer should be\\r\\nabandoned, and from that time the child will be able to read slowly\\r\\nthe most difficult words in the language. We must observe, that the\\r\\nmark of obliteration is of the greatest service; it is a clue to the\\r\\nwhole labyrinth of intricate and uncouth orthography. The word though,\\r\\nby the obliteration of three letters, may be as easily read as _the_\\r\\nor _that_.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be observed that all people, before they can read fluently,\\r\\nhave acquired a knowledge of the general appearance of most of the\\r\\nwords in the language, independently of the syllables of which they\\r\\nare composed. Seven children in the author\\'s family were taught to\\r\\nread in this manner, and three in the common method; the difference\\r\\nof time, labour, and sorrow, between the two modes of learning,\\r\\nappeared so clearly, that we can speak with confidence upon the\\r\\nsubject. We think that nine-tenths of the labour and disgust of\\r\\nlearning to read, may be saved by this method; and that instead of\\r\\nfrowns and tears, the usual harbingers of learning, cheerfulness and\\r\\nsmiles may initiate willing pupils in the most difficult of all human\\r\\nattainments.\\r\\n\\r\\nA and H, at four and five years old, after they had learned the\\r\\nalphabet, without having ever combined the letters into syllables,\\r\\nwere set to read one of Mrs. Barbauld\\'s little books. After being\\r\\nemployed two or three minutes every day, for a fortnight, in making\\r\\nout the words of this book, a paper with a few raisins well concealed\\r\\nin its folds, was given to each of them, with these words printed on\\r\\nthe outside of it, marked according to our alphabet:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Open this, and eat what you find in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn twenty minutes, they read it distinctly without any assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe step from reading with these marks, to reading without them, will\\r\\nbe found very easy. Nothing more is necessary, than to give children\\r\\nthe same books, without marks, which they can read fluently with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpelling comes next to reading. New trials for the temper; new perils\\r\\nfor the understanding; positive rules and arbitrary exceptions;\\r\\nendless examples and contradictions; till at length, out of all\\r\\npatience with the stupid docility of his pupil, the tutor perceives\\r\\nthe absolute necessity of making him get by heart, with all convenient\\r\\nspeed, every word in the language. The formidable columns in dread\\r\\nsuccession arise a host of foes; two columns a day, at least, may be\\r\\nconquered. Months and years are devoted to the undertaking; but after\\r\\ngoing through a whole spelling-book, perhaps a whole dictionary, till\\r\\nwe come triumphantly to spell _Zeugma_, we have forgotten to spell\\r\\n_Abbot_, and we must begin again with _Abasement_. Merely the learning\\r\\nto spell so many unconnected words, without any assistance from reason\\r\\nor analogy, is nothing, compared with the difficulty of learning the\\r\\nexplanation of them by rote, and the still greater difficulty of\\r\\nunderstanding the meaning of the explanation. When a child has got by\\r\\nrote,\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Midnight, the _depth_ of night;\"\\r\\n    \"Metaphysics, the science which treats of immaterial\\r\\n    beings, and of forms in general abstracted from matter;\"\\r\\n\\r\\nhas he acquired any distinct ideas, either of midnight or of\\r\\nmetaphysics? If a boy had eaten rice pudding, till he fancied himself\\r\\ntolerably well acquainted with rice, would he find his knowledge much\\r\\nimproved, by learning from his spelling-book, the words\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Rice, a foreign esculent grain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYet we are surprised to discover, that men have so few accurate ideas,\\r\\nand that so many learned disputes originate in a confused or improper\\r\\nuse of words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All this is very true,\" says a candid schoolmaster; \"we see the evil,\\r\\nbut we cannot new-model the language, or write a perfect philosophical\\r\\ndictionary; and, in the mean time, we are bound to teach children to\\r\\nspell, which we do with the less reluctance, because, though we allow\\r\\nthat it is an arduous task, we have found from experience, that it can\\r\\nbe accomplished, and that the understandings of many of our pupils,\\r\\nsurvive all the perils to which you think them exposed during the\\r\\noperation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe understandings may, and do, survive the operation; but why should\\r\\nthey be put in unnecessary danger? and why should we early disgust\\r\\nchildren with literature, by the pain and difficulty their first\\r\\nlessons? We are convinced, that the business of learning to spell, is\\r\\nmade much more laborious to children than it need to be: it may be\\r\\nuseful to give them five or six words every day to learn by heart,\\r\\nbut more only loads their memory; and we should, at first, select\\r\\nwords of which they know the meaning, and which occur most frequently\\r\\nin reading or conversation. The alphabetical list of words in a\\r\\nspelling-book, contains many which are not in common use, and the\\r\\npupil forgets these as fast as he learns them. We have found it\\r\\nentertaining to children, to ask them to spell any short sentence as\\r\\nit has been accidentally spoken. \"Put this book on that table.\" Ask a\\r\\nchild how he would spell these words, if he were obliged to write them\\r\\ndown, and you introduce into his mind the idea that he must learn to\\r\\nspell, before he can make his words and thoughts understood in\\r\\nwriting. It is a good way to make children write down a few words of\\r\\ntheir own selection every day, and correct the spelling; and also\\r\\nafter they have been reading, whilst the words are yet fresh in their\\r\\nmemory, we may ask them to spell some of the words which they have\\r\\njust seen. By these means, and by repeating, at different times in the\\r\\nday, those words which are most frequently wanted, his vocabulary will\\r\\nbe pretty well stocked without its having cost him many tears. We\\r\\nshould observe that children learn to spell more by the eye than by\\r\\nthe ear, and that the more they read and write, the more likely they\\r\\nwill be to remember the combination of letters in words which they\\r\\nhave continually before their eyes, or which they feel it necessary to\\r\\nrepresent to others. When young people begin to write, they first feel\\r\\nthe use of spelling, and it is then that they will learn it with most\\r\\nease and precision. Then the greatest care should be taken to look\\r\\nover their writing, and to make them correct every word in which they\\r\\nhave made a mistake; because, bad habits of spelling, once contracted,\\r\\ncan scarcely be cured: the understanding has nothing to do with the\\r\\nbusiness, and when the memory is puzzled between the rules of spelling\\r\\nright, and the habits of spelling wrong, it becomes a misfortune to\\r\\nthe pupil to write even a common letter. The shame which is annexed to\\r\\nbad spelling, excites young people\\'s attention, as soon as they are\\r\\nable to understand, that it is considered as a mark of ignorance and\\r\\nill breeding. We have often observed, that children listen with\\r\\nanxiety to the remarks that are made upon this subject in their\\r\\npresence, especially when the letters or notes of _grown up people_,\\r\\nare criticised.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time ago, a lady, who was reading a newspaper, met with the story\\r\\nof an ignorant magistrate, who gave for his toast, at a public dinner,\\r\\nthe two K\\'s, for the King and Constitution. \"How very much ashamed the\\r\\nman must have felt, when all the people laughed at him for his\\r\\nmistake! they must all have seen that he did not know how to spell;\\r\\nand what a disgrace for a magistrate too!\" said a boy who heard the\\r\\nanecdote. It made a serious impression upon him. A few months\\r\\nafterwards, he was employed by his father in an occupation which was\\r\\nextremely agreeable to him, but in which he continually felt the\\r\\nnecessity of spelling correctly. He was employed to send messages by a\\r\\ntelegraph; these messages he was obliged to write down hastily, in\\r\\nlittle journals kept for the purpose; and as these were seen by\\r\\nseveral people, when the business of the day came to be reviewed, the\\r\\nboy had a considerable motive for orthographical exactness. He became\\r\\nextremely desirous to teach himself, and consequently his success was\\r\\nfrom that moment certain. As to the rest, we refer to Lady Carlisle\\'s\\r\\ncomprehensive maxim, \"Spell well if you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is undoubtedly of consequence, to teach the rudiments of literary\\r\\neducation early, to get over the first difficulties of reading,\\r\\nwriting, and spelling; but much of the anxiety and bustle, and labour\\r\\nof teaching these things, may be advantageously spared. If more\\r\\nattention were turned to the general cultivation of the understanding,\\r\\nand if more pains were taken to make literature agreeable to\\r\\nchildren, there would be found less difficulty to excite them to\\r\\nmental exertion, or to induce the habits of persevering application.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we speak of rendering literature agreeable to children, and of\\r\\nthe danger of associating pain with the sight of a book, or with the\\r\\nsound of the word _task_, we should at the same time avoid the errour\\r\\nof those who, in their first lessons, accustom their pupils to so much\\r\\namusement, that they cannot help afterwards feeling disgusted with the\\r\\nsobriety of instruction. It has been the fashion of late to attempt\\r\\nteaching every thing to children in play, and ingenious people have\\r\\ncontrived to insinuate much useful knowledge without betraying the\\r\\ndesign to instruct; but this system cannot be pursued beyond certain\\r\\nbounds without many inconveniences. The habit of being amused not only\\r\\nincreases the desire for amusement, but it lessens even the relish for\\r\\npleasure; so that the mind becomes passive and indolent, and a course\\r\\nof perpetually increasing stimulus is necessary to awaken attention.\\r\\nWhen dissipated habits are required, the pupil loses power over his\\r\\nown mind, and, instead of vigorous voluntary exertion, which he should\\r\\nbe able to command, he shows that wayward imbecility, which can think\\r\\nsuccessfully only by fits and starts: this paralytic state of mind has\\r\\nbeen found to be one of the greatest calamities attendant on what is\\r\\ncalled genius; and injudicious education creates or increases this\\r\\ndisease. Let us not therefore humour children in this capricious\\r\\ntemper, especially if they have quick abilities: let us give rewards\\r\\nproportioned to their exertions with uniform justice, but let us not\\r\\ngrant bounties in education, which, however they may appear to succeed\\r\\nin effecting partial and temporary purposes, are not calculated to\\r\\nensure any consequences permanently beneficial. The truth is, that\\r\\nuseful knowledge cannot be obtained without labour; that attention\\r\\nlong continued is laborious, but that without this labour nothing\\r\\nexcellent can be accomplished. Excite a child to attend in earnest\\r\\nfor a short time, his mind will be less fatigued, and his\\r\\nunderstanding more improved, than if he had exerted but half the\\r\\nenergy twice as long: the degree of pain which he may have felt will\\r\\nbe amply and properly compensated by his success; this will not be an\\r\\narbitrary, variable reward, but one within his own power, and that can\\r\\nbe ascertained by his own feelings. Here is no deceit practised, no\\r\\nillusion; the same course of conduct may be regularly pursued through\\r\\nthe whole of his education, and his confidence in his tutor will\\r\\nprogressively increase. On the contrary, if, to entice him to enter\\r\\nthe paths of knowledge, we strew them with flowers, how will he feel\\r\\nwhen he must force his way through thorns and briars!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a material difference between teaching children in play, and\\r\\nmaking learning a task; in the one case we associate factitious\\r\\npleasure, in the other factitious pain, with the object: both produce\\r\\npernicious effects upon the temper, and retard the natural progress of\\r\\nthe understanding. The advocates in favour of \"scholastic badinage\"\\r\\nhave urged, that it excites an interest in the minds of children\\r\\nsimilar to that which makes them endure a considerable degree of\\r\\nlabour in the pursuit of their amusements. Children, it is said, work\\r\\nhard at play, therefore we should let them play at work. Would not\\r\\nthis produce effects the very reverse of what we desire? The whole\\r\\nquestion must at last depend upon the meaning of the word play: if by\\r\\nplay be meant every thing that is not usually called a task, then\\r\\nundoubtedly much may be learned at play: if, on the contrary, we mean\\r\\nby the expression to describe that state of fidgeting idleness, or of\\r\\nboisterous activity, in which the intellectual powers are torpid, or\\r\\nstunned with unmeaning noise, the assertion contradicts itself. At\\r\\nplay so defined, children can learn nothing but bodily activity; it is\\r\\ncertainly true, that when children are interested about any thing,\\r\\nwhether it be about what we call a trifle, or a matter of consequence,\\r\\nthey will exert themselves in order to succeed; but from the moment\\r\\nthe attention is fixed, no matter on what, children are no longer at\\r\\nidle play, they are at active work.\\r\\n\\r\\nS----, a little boy of nine years old, was standing without any book\\r\\nin his hand, and seemingly idle; he was amusing himself with looking\\r\\nat what he called a rainbow upon the floor; he begged his sister\\r\\nM----to look at it; then he said he wondered what could make it; how\\r\\nit came there. The sun shone bright through the window; the boy moved\\r\\nseveral things in the room, so as to place them sometimes between the\\r\\nlight and the colours which he saw upon the floor, and sometimes in a\\r\\ncorner of the room where the sun did not shine. As he moved the\\r\\nthings, he said, \"This is not it;\" \"nor this;\" \"this has\\'n\\'t any thing\\r\\nto do with it.\" At last he found, that when he moved a tumbler of\\r\\nwater out of the place where it stood, his rainbow vanished. Some\\r\\nviolets were in the tumbler; S---- thought they might be the cause of\\r\\nthe colours which he saw upon the floor, or, as he expressed it,\\r\\n\"Perhaps these may be the thing.\" He took the violets out of the\\r\\nwater; the colours remained upon the floor. He then thought that \"it\\r\\nmight be the water.\" He emptied the glass; the colours remained, but\\r\\nthey were fainter. S---- immediately observed, that it was the water\\r\\nand glass together that made the rainbow. \"But,\" said he, \"there is no\\r\\nglass in the sky, yet there is a rainbow, so that I think the water\\r\\nalone would do, if we could but hold it together without the glass. Oh\\r\\nI know how I can manage.\" He poured the water slowly out of the\\r\\ntumbler into a basin, which he placed where the sun shone, and he saw\\r\\nthe colours on the floor twinkling behind the water as it fell: this\\r\\ndelighted him much; but he asked why it would not do when the sun did\\r\\nnot shine. The sun went behind a cloud whilst he was trying his\\r\\nexperiments: \"There was light,\" said he, \"though there was no\\r\\nsunshine.\" He then said he thought that the different thickness of the\\r\\nglass was the cause of the variety of colours: afterwards he said he\\r\\nthought that the clearness or muddiness of the different drops of\\r\\nwater was the cause of the different colours.\\r\\n\\r\\nA rigid preceptor, who thinks that every boy must be idle who has not\\r\\na Latin book constantly in his hand, would perhaps have reprimanded\\r\\nS---- for wasting his time _at play_, and would have summoned him from\\r\\nhis rainbow to his _task_; but it is very obvious to any person free\\r\\nfrom prejudices, that this child was not idle whilst he was meditating\\r\\nupon the rainbow on the floor; his attention was fixed; he was\\r\\nreasoning; he was trying experiments. We may call this _play_ if we\\r\\nplease, and we may say that Descartes was at play, when he first\\r\\nverified Antonio de Dominis bishop of Spalatro\\'s treatise of the\\r\\nrainbow, by an experiment with a glass Globe:[8] and we may say that\\r\\nBuffon was idle, when his pleased attention was first caught with a\\r\\nlandscape of green shadows, when one evening at sunset he first\\r\\nobserved that the shadows of trees, which fell upon a white wall, were\\r\\ngreen. He was first delighted with the exact representation of a green\\r\\narbour, which seemed as if it had been newly painted on the wall.\\r\\nCertainly the boy with his rainbow on the floor was as much amused as\\r\\nthe philosopher with his coloured shadows; and, however high sounding\\r\\nthe name of Antonio de Dominis, bishop of Spalatro, it does not alter\\r\\nthe business in the least; he could have exerted only his _utmost\\r\\nattention_ upon the theory of the rainbow, and the child did the same.\\r\\nWe do not mean to compare the powers of reasoning, or the abilities of\\r\\nthe child and the philosopher; we would only show that the same\\r\\nspecies of attention was exerted by both.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo fix the attention of children, or, in other words, to interest\\r\\nthem about those subjects to which we wish them to apply, must be our\\r\\nfirst object in the early cultivation of the understanding. This we\\r\\nshall not find a difficult undertaking if we have no false\\r\\nassociations, no painful recollections to contend with. We can connect\\r\\nany species of knowledge with those occupations which are immediately\\r\\nagreeable to young people: for instance, if a child is building a\\r\\nhouse, we may take that opportunity to teach him how bricks are made,\\r\\nhow the arches over doors and windows are made, the nature of the\\r\\nkeystone and butments of an arch, the manner in which all the\\r\\ndifferent parts of the roof of a house are put together, &c.; whilst\\r\\nhe is learning all this he is eagerly and seriously attentive, and we\\r\\neducate his understanding in the best possible method. But if,\\r\\nmistaking the application of the principle, that literature should be\\r\\nmade agreeable to children, we should entice a child to learn his\\r\\nletters by a promise of a gilt coach, or by telling him that he would\\r\\nbe the cleverest boy in the world if he could but learn the letter\\r\\n_A_, we use false and foolish motives; we may possibly, by such means,\\r\\neffect the immediate purpose, but we shall assuredly have reason to\\r\\nrepent of such imprudent deceit. If the child reasons at all, he will\\r\\nbe content after his first lesson with being \"the cleverest boy in the\\r\\nworld,\" and he will not, on a future occasion, hazard his fame, having\\r\\nmuch to lose, and nothing to gain; besides, he is now master of a gilt\\r\\ncoach, and some new and larger reward must be proffered to excite his\\r\\nindustry. Besides the disadvantage of early exhausting our stock of\\r\\nincitements, it is dangerous in teaching to humour pupils with a\\r\\nvariety of objects by way of relieving their attention. The pleasure\\r\\nof _thinking_, and much of the profit, must frequently depend upon our\\r\\npreserving the greatest possible connection between our ideas. Those\\r\\nwho allow themselves to start from one object to another, acquire such\\r\\ndissipated habits of mind, that they cannot, without extreme\\r\\ndifficulty and reluctance, follow any connected train of thought. You\\r\\ncannot teach those who will not follow the chain of your reasons; upon\\r\\nthe connection of our ideas, useful memory and reasoning must depend.\\r\\nWe will give you an instance: arithmetic is one of the first things\\r\\nthat we attempt to teach children. In the following dialogue, which\\r\\npassed between a boy of five years old and his father, we may observe\\r\\nthat, till the child followed his father\\'s train of ideas, he could\\r\\nnot be taught.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ _S----_, how many can you take from one?\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ None.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ None! Think; can you take nothing from one?\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ None, except that one.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Except! Then you can take one from one?\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ Yes, _that one_.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ How many then can you take from one?\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ One.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Very true; but now, can you take two from one?\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ Yes, if they were figures I could, with a rubber-out. (This\\r\\nchild had frequently sums written for him with a black lead pencil,\\r\\nand he used to rub out his figures when they were wrong with Indian\\r\\nrubber, which he had heard called _rubber-out_.)\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Yes, you could; but now we will not talk of figures, we will\\r\\ntalk of things. There may be one horse or two horses, or one man or\\r\\ntwo men.\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ Yes, or one coat or two coats.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Yes, or one thing or two things, no matter what they are.\\r\\nNow, could you take two things from one thing?\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ Yes, if there were three things I could take away two things,\\r\\nand leave one.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis Father took up a cake from the tea-table.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Could I take two cakes from this one cake?\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ You could take two pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis Father divided the cake into halves, and held up each half so that\\r\\nthe child might distinctly see them.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ What would you call these two pieces?\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ Two cakes.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ No, not two cakes.\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ Two biscuits.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Holding up a whole biscuit: What is this?\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ A thing to eat.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Yes, but what would you call it?\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ A biscuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis Father broke it into halves, and showed one half.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ What would you call this?\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ was silent, and his sister was applied to, who answered,\\r\\n\"Half a biscuit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Very well; that\\'s all at present.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father prudently stopped here, that he might not confuse his\\r\\npupil\\'s understanding. Those only who have attempted to teach children\\r\\ncan conceive how extremely difficult it is to fix their attention, or\\r\\nto make them seize the connection of ideas, which it appears to us\\r\\nalmost impossible to miss. Children are well occupied in examining\\r\\nexternal objects, but they must also attend to words as well as\\r\\nthings. One of the great difficulties in early instruction arises from\\r\\nthe want of words: the pupil very often has acquired the necessary\\r\\nideas, but they are not associated in his mind with the words which\\r\\nhis tutor uses; these words are then to him mere sounds, which suggest\\r\\nno correspondent thoughts. Words, as M. Condillac well observes,[9]\\r\\nare essential to our acquisition of knowledge; they are the medium\\r\\nthrough which one set of beings can convey the result of their\\r\\nexperiments and observations to another; they are, in all mental\\r\\nprocesses, the algebraic signs which assist us in solving the most\\r\\ndifficult problems. What agony does a foreigner, knowing himself to be\\r\\na man of sense, appear to suffer, when, for want of language, he\\r\\ncannot in conversation communicate his knowledge, explain his reasons,\\r\\nenforce his arguments, or make his wit intelligible? In vain he has\\r\\nrecourse to the language of action. The language of action, or, as\\r\\nBacon calls it, of \"transitory hieroglyphic,\" is expressive, but\\r\\ninadequate. As new ideas are collected in the mind, new signs are\\r\\nwanted, and the progress of the understanding would be early and\\r\\nfatally impeded by the want of language. M. de la Condamine tells us\\r\\nthat there is a nation who have no sign to express the number three\\r\\nbut this word, _poellartarrorincourac_. These people having begun, as\\r\\nCondillac observes, in such an incommodious manner, it is not\\r\\nsurprising that they have not advanced further in their knowledge of\\r\\narithmetic: they have got no further than the number three; their\\r\\nknowledge of arithmetic stops for ever at _poellartarrorincourac_. But\\r\\neven this cumbersome sign is better than none. Those who have the\\r\\nmisfortune to be born deaf and dumb, continue for ever in intellectual\\r\\nimbecility. There is an account in the Memoires de l\\'Academie Royale,\\r\\np. xxii-xxiii, 1703, of a young man born deaf and dumb,[10] who\\r\\nrecovered his hearing at the age of four-and-twenty, and who, after\\r\\nemploying himself in repeating low to himself the words which he heard\\r\\nothers pronounce, at length broke silence in company, and declared\\r\\nthat he could talk. His conversation was but imperfect; he was\\r\\nexamined by several able theologians, who chiefly questioned him on\\r\\nhis ideas of God, the soul, and the morality or immorality of actions.\\r\\nIt appeared that he had not thought upon any of these subjects; he did\\r\\nnot distinctly know what was meant by death, and he never thought of\\r\\nit. He seemed to pass a merely animal life, occupied with sensible,\\r\\npresent objects, and with the few ideas which he received by his sense\\r\\nof sight; nor did he seem to have gained as much knowledge as he might\\r\\nhave done, by the comparison of these ideas; yet it is said that he\\r\\ndid not appear naturally deficient in understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeter, the wild boy, who is mentioned in Lord Monboddo\\'s Origin of\\r\\nLanguage,[11] had all his senses in remarkable perfection. He lived at\\r\\na farm house within half a mile of us in Hertfordshire for some years,\\r\\nand we had frequent opportunities of trying experiments upon him. He\\r\\ncould articulate imperfectly a few words, in particular, _King\\r\\nGeorge_, which words he always accompanied with an imitation of the\\r\\nbells, which rang at the coronation of George the Second; he could in\\r\\na rude manner imitate two or three common tunes, but without words.\\r\\nThough his head, as Mr. Wedgewood and many others had remarked,\\r\\nresembled that of Socrates, he was an idiot: he had acquired a few\\r\\nautomatic habits of rationality and industry, but he could never be\\r\\nmade to work at any continued occupation: he would shut the door of\\r\\nthe farm-yard five hundred times a day, but he would not reap or make\\r\\nhay. Drawing water from a neighbouring river was the only domestic\\r\\nbusiness which he regularly pursued. In 1779 we visited him, and tried\\r\\nthe following experiment. He was attended to the river by a person who\\r\\nemptied his buckets repeatedly after Peter had repeatedly filled them.\\r\\nA shilling was put before his face into one of the buckets when it was\\r\\nempty; he took no notice of it, but filled it with water and carried\\r\\nit homeward: his buckets were taken from him before he reached the\\r\\nhouse and emptied on the ground; the shilling, which had fallen out,\\r\\nwas again shown to him, and put into the bucket. Peter returned to the\\r\\nriver again, filled his bucket and went home; and when the bucket was\\r\\nemptied by the maid at the house where he lived, he took the shilling\\r\\nand laid it in a place where he was accustomed to deposit the presents\\r\\nthat were made to him by curious strangers, and whence the farmer\\'s\\r\\nwife collected the price of his daily exhibition. It appeared that\\r\\nthis savage could not be taught to reason for want of language.\\r\\n\\r\\nRousseau declaims with eloquence, and often with justice, against what\\r\\nhe calls a knowledge of words. Words without correspondent ideas, are\\r\\nworse than useless; they are counterfeit coin, which imposes upon the\\r\\nignorant and unwary; but words, which really represent ideas, are not\\r\\nonly of current use, but of sterling value; they not only show our\\r\\npresent store, but they increase our wealth, by keeping it in\\r\\ncontinual circulation; both the principal and the interest increase\\r\\ntogether. The importance of signs and words, in our reasonings, has\\r\\nbeen eloquently explained, since the time of Condillac, by Stewart. We\\r\\nmust use the ideas of these excellent writers, because they are just\\r\\nand applicable to the art of education; but whilst we use, it is with\\r\\nproper acknowledgments that we borrow, what we shall never be able to\\r\\nreturn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a nice and difficult thing in education, to proportion a child\\'s\\r\\nvocabulary exactly to his knowledge, dispositions, or conformation;\\r\\nour management must vary; some will acquire words too quickly, others\\r\\ntoo slowly. A child who has great facility in pronouncing sounds,\\r\\nwill, for that reason, quickly acquire a number of words, whilst those\\r\\nwhose organs of speech are not so happily formed, will from that cause\\r\\nalone, be ready in forming a copious vocabulary. Children who have\\r\\nmany companions, or who live with people who converse a great deal,\\r\\nhave more motive, both from sympathy and emulation, to acquire a\\r\\nvariety of words, than those who live with silent people, and who have\\r\\nfew companions of their own age. All these circumstances should be\\r\\nconsidered by parents, before they form their judgment of a child\\'s\\r\\ncapacity from his volubility or his taciturnity. Volubility can easily\\r\\nbe checked by simply ceasing to attend to it, and taciturnity may be\\r\\nvanquished by the encouragements of praise and affection: we should\\r\\nneither be alarmed at one disposition nor at the other, but steadily\\r\\npursue the system of conduct which will be most advantageous to both.\\r\\nWhen a prattling, vivacious child, pours forth a multiplicity of words\\r\\nwithout understanding their meaning, we may sometimes beg to have an\\r\\nexplanation of a few of them, and the child will then be obliged to\\r\\nthink, which will prevent him from talking nonsense another time. When\\r\\na thoughtful boy, who is in the habit of observing every object he\\r\\nsees, is at a loss for words to express his ideas, his countenance\\r\\nusually shows to those who can read the countenance of children, that\\r\\nhe is not stupid; therefore, we need not urge him to talk, but assist\\r\\nhim judiciously with words \"in his utmost need:\" at the same time we\\r\\nshould observe carefully, whether he grows lazy when we assist him; if\\r\\nhis stock of words does not increase in proportion to the assistance\\r\\nwe give, we should then stimulate him to exertion, or else he will\\r\\nbecome habitually indolent in expressing his ideas; though he may\\r\\n_think_ in a language of his own, he will not be able to understand\\r\\nour language when we attempt to teach him: this would be a source of\\r\\ndaily misery to both parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen children begin to read, they seem suddenly to acquire a great\\r\\nvariety of words: we should carefully examine whether they annex the\\r\\nproper meaning to these which are so rapidly collected. Instead of\\r\\ngiving them lessons and tasks to get by rote, we should cautiously\\r\\nwatch over every new phrase and every new word which they learn from\\r\\nbooks. There are but few books so written that young children can\\r\\ncomprehend a single sentence in them without much explanation. It is\\r\\ntiresome to those who hear them read to explain every word; it is not\\r\\nonly tiresome, but difficult; besides, the progress of the pupil seems\\r\\nto be retarded; the grand business of reading, of getting through the\\r\\nbook, is impeded; and the tutor, more impatient than his pupil, says,\\r\\n\"Read on, I cannot stop to explain _that_ to you now. You will\\r\\nunderstand the meaning of the sentence if you will read to the end of\\r\\nthe page. You have not read three lines this half hour; we shall never\\r\\nget on at this rate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA certain dame at a country school, who had never been able to compass\\r\\nthe word Nebuchadnezzar, used to desire her pupils to \"call it\\r\\nNazareth, and let it pass.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they be obliged to pass over words without comprehending them in\\r\\nbooks, they will probably do the same in conversation; and the\\r\\ndifficulty of teaching such pupils, and of understanding what they\\r\\nsay, will be equally increased. At the hazard of being tedious, we\\r\\nmust dwell a little longer upon this subject, because much of the\\r\\nfuture capacity of children seems to depend upon the manner in which\\r\\nthey first acquire language. If their language be confused, so will be\\r\\ntheir thoughts; and they will not be able to reason, to invent, or to\\r\\nwrite, with more precision and accuracy than they speak. The first\\r\\nwords that children learn are the names of things; these are easily\\r\\nassociated with the objects themselves, and there is little danger of\\r\\nmistake or confusion. We will not enter into the grammatical dispute\\r\\nconcerning the right of precedency, amongst pronoun substantives and\\r\\nverbs; we do not know which came first into the mind of man; perhaps,\\r\\nin different minds, and in different circumstances, the precedency\\r\\nmust have varied; but this seems to be of little consequence; children\\r\\nsee actions performed, and they act themselves; when they want to\\r\\nexpress their remembrance of these actions, they make use of the sort\\r\\nof words which we call verbs. Let these words be strictly associated\\r\\nwith the ideas which they mean to express, and no matter whether\\r\\nchildren know any thing about the disputes of grammarians, they will\\r\\nunderstand rational grammar in due time, simply by reflecting upon\\r\\ntheir own minds. This we shall explain more fully when we speak\\r\\nhereafter of grammar; we just mention the subject here, to warn\\r\\npreceptors against puzzling their pupils too early with grammatical\\r\\nsubtleties.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf any person unused to mechanics was to read Dr. Desagulier\\'s\\r\\ndescription of the manner in which a man walks, the number of a-b-c\\'s,\\r\\nand the travels of the centre of gravity, it would so amaze and\\r\\nconfound him, that he would scarcely believe he could ever again\\r\\nperform such a tremendous operation as that of walking. Children, if\\r\\nthey were early to hear grammarians talk of the parts of speech, and\\r\\nof syntax, would conclude, that to speak must be one of the most\\r\\ndifficult arts in the world; but children, who are not usually so\\r\\nunfortunate as to have grammarians for their preceptors, when they\\r\\nfirst begin to speak, acquire language, without being aware of the\\r\\ndifficulties which would appear so formidable in theory. A child\\r\\npoints to, or touches, the table, and when the word table is repeated,\\r\\nat the same instant he learns the name of the thing. The facility with\\r\\nwhich a number of names are thus learned in infancy is surprising; but\\r\\nwe must not imagine that the child, in learning these names, has\\r\\nacquired much knowledge; he has prepared himself to be taught, but he\\r\\nhas not yet learnt any thing accurately. When a child sees a guinea\\r\\nand a shilling, and smiling says, \"That\\'s a guinea, mama! and that\\'s a\\r\\nshilling!\" the mother is pleased and surprised by her son\\'s\\r\\nintelligence, and she gives him credit for more than he really\\r\\npossesses. We have associated with the words guinea and shilling a\\r\\nnumber of ideas, and when we hear the same words pronounced by a young\\r\\nchild, we perhaps have some confused belief that he has acquired the\\r\\nsame ideas that we have; hence we are pleased with the mere sound of\\r\\nwords of high import from infantine lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren who are delighted in their turn by the expression of pleasure\\r\\nin the countenance of others, repeat the things which they perceive\\r\\nhave pleased; and thus their education is begun by those who first\\r\\nsmile upon them, and listen to them when they attempt to speak. They\\r\\nwho applaud children for knowing the names of things, induce them\\r\\nquickly to learn a number of names by rote; as long as they learn the\\r\\nnames of external objects only, which they can see, and smell, and\\r\\ntouch, all is well; the names will convey distinct ideas of certain\\r\\nperceptions. A child who learns the name of a taste, or of a colour,\\r\\nwho learns that the taste of sugar is called sweet, and that the\\r\\ncolour of a red rose is called red, has learned distinct words to\\r\\nexpress certain perceptions: and we can at any future time recall to\\r\\nhis mind the memory of those perceptions by means of their names, and\\r\\nhe understands us as well as the most learned philosopher. But,\\r\\nsuppose that a boy had learned only the name of gold; that when\\r\\ndifferent metals were shown to him, he could put his finger upon gold,\\r\\nand say, \"That is gold;\" yet this boy does not know all the properties\\r\\nof gold; he does not know in what it differs from other metals; to\\r\\nwhat uses it is applied in arts, manufactures, and commerce; the name\\r\\nof gold, in his mind, represents nothing more than a substance of a\\r\\nbright yellow colour, upon which people, he does not precisely know\\r\\nwhy, set a great value. Now, it is very possible, that a child might,\\r\\non the contrary, learn all the properties, and the various uses of\\r\\ngold, without having learned its name; his ideas of this metal would\\r\\nbe perfectly distinct; but whenever he wished to speak of gold, he\\r\\nwould be obliged to use a vast deal of circumlocution to make himself\\r\\nunderstood; and if he were to enumerate all the properties of the\\r\\nmetal every time he wanted to recal the general idea, his\\r\\nconversation would be intolerably tedious to others, and to himself\\r\\nthis useless repetition must be extremely laborious. He would\\r\\ncertainly be glad to learn that single word _gold_, which would save\\r\\nhim so much trouble; his understanding would appear suddenly to have\\r\\nimproved, simply from his having acquired a proper sign to represent\\r\\nhis ideas. The boy who had learnt the name, without knowing any of the\\r\\nproperties of gold, would also appear comparatively ignorant, as soon\\r\\nas it is discovered that he has few ideas annexed to the word. It is,\\r\\nperhaps, for this reason, that some children seem suddenly to shine\\r\\nout with knowledge, which no one suspected they possessed; whilst\\r\\nothers, who had appeared to be very quick and clever, come to a dead\\r\\nstop in their education, and appear to be blighted by some unknown\\r\\ncause. The children who suddenly shine out, are those who had acquired\\r\\na number of ideas, and who, the moment they acquire proper words, can\\r\\ncommunicate their thoughts to others. Those children who suddenly seem\\r\\nto lose their superiority, are those who had acquired a variety of\\r\\nwords, but who had not annexed ideas to them. When their ignorance is\\r\\ndetected, we not only despair of them, but they are apt to despair of\\r\\nthemselves; they see their companions get before them, and they do not\\r\\nexactly perceive the cause of their sudden incapacity. Where we speak\\r\\nof sensible, visible, tangible objects, we can easily detect and\\r\\nremedy a child\\'s ignorance. It is easy to discover whether he has or\\r\\nhas not a complete notion of such a substance as gold; we can\\r\\nenumerate its properties, and readily point out in what his definition\\r\\nis defective. The substance can be easily produced for examination;\\r\\nmost of its properties are obvious to the senses; we have nothing to\\r\\ndo but to show them to the child, and to associate with each property\\r\\nits usual name; here there can be no danger of puzzling his\\r\\nunderstanding; but when we come to the explanation of words which do\\r\\nnot represent external objects, we shall find the affair more\\r\\ndifficult. We can make children understand the meaning of those words\\r\\nwhich are the names of simple feelings of the mind, such as surprise,\\r\\njoy, grief, pity; because we can either put our pupils in situations\\r\\nwhere they actually feel these sensations, and then we may associate\\r\\nthe name with the feelings; or we may, by the example of other people,\\r\\nwho actually suffer pain or enjoy pleasure, point out what we mean by\\r\\nthe words joy and grief. But how shall we explain to our young pupils,\\r\\na number of words which represent neither existing substances nor\\r\\nsimple feelings, when we can neither recur to experiment nor to\\r\\nsympathy for assistance? How shall we explain, for instance, the words\\r\\nvirtue, justice, benevolence, beauty, taste, &c.? To analyze our own\\r\\nideas of these, is no easy task; to explain the process to a young\\r\\nchild, is scarcely possible. Call upon any man, who has read and\\r\\nreflected, for a definition of virtue, the whole \"theory of moral\\r\\nsentiments\" rises, perhaps, to his view at once, in all its elegance;\\r\\nthe paradoxical acumen of Mandeville, the perspicuous reasoning of\\r\\nHume, the accurate metaphysics of Condillac, the persuasive eloquence\\r\\nof Stewart; all the various doctrines that have been supported\\r\\nconcerning the foundation of morals, such as the fitness of things,\\r\\nthe moral sense, the beauty of truth, utility, sympathy, common sense;\\r\\nall that has been said by ancient and modern philosophers, is recalled\\r\\nin transient perplexing succession to his memory. If such be the state\\r\\nof mind of the man who is to define, what must be the condition of the\\r\\nchild who is to understand the definition? All that a prudent person\\r\\nwill attempt, is to give instances of different virtues; but even\\r\\nthese, it will be difficult properly to select for a child. General\\r\\nterms, whether in morals or in natural philosophy, should, we\\r\\napprehend, be as much as possible avoided in early education. Some\\r\\npeople may imagine that children have improved in virtue and wisdom,\\r\\nwhen they can talk fluently of justice, and charity, and humanity;\\r\\nwhen they can read with a good emphasis any didactic compositions in\\r\\nverse or prose. But let any person of sober, common sense, be allowed\\r\\nto cross-examine these proficients, and the pretended extent of their\\r\\nknowledge will shrink into a narrow compass; nor will their virtues,\\r\\nwhich have never seen service, be ready for action.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral terms are, as it were, but the indorsements upon the bundles\\r\\nof our ideas; they are useful to those who have collected a number of\\r\\nideas, but utterly useless to those who have no collections ready for\\r\\nclassification: nor should we be in a hurry to tie up the bundles,\\r\\ntill we are sure that the collection is tolerably complete; the\\r\\ntrouble, the difficulty, the shame of untying them late in life, is\\r\\nfelt even by superior minds. \"Sir,\" said Dr. Johnson, \"I don\\'t like to\\r\\nhave any of my opinions attacked. I have made up my faggot, and if you\\r\\ndraw out one you weaken the whole bundle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPreceptors sometimes explain general terms and abstract notions\\r\\nvaguely to their pupils, simply because they are ashamed to make that\\r\\nanswer which every sensible person must frequently make to a child\\'s\\r\\ninquiries, \"I don\\'t know.\"[12] Surely it is much better to say at\\r\\nonce, \"I cannot explain this to you,\" than to attempt an imperfect or\\r\\nsophistical reply. Fortunately for us, children, if they are not\\r\\nforced to attend to studies for which they have no taste, will not\\r\\ntrouble us much with moral and metaphysical questions; their attention\\r\\nwill be fully employed upon external objects; intent upon experiments,\\r\\nthey will not be very inquisitive about theories. Let us then take\\r\\ncare that their simple ideas be accurate, and when these are\\r\\ncompounded, their complex notions, their principles, opinions, and\\r\\ntastes, will necessarily be just; their language will then be as\\r\\naccurate as their ideas are distinct; and hence they will be enabled\\r\\nto reason with precision, and to invent with facility. We may observe,\\r\\nthat the great difficulty in reasoning is to fix steadily upon our\\r\\nterms; ideas can be readily compared, when the words by which we\\r\\nexpress them are defined; as in arithmetic and algebra, we can easily\\r\\nsolve any problem, when we have precise signs for all the numbers and\\r\\nquantities which are to be considered.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not from idleness, it is not from stupidity, it is not from\\r\\nobstinacy, that children frequently show an indisposition to listen to\\r\\nthose who attempt to explain things to them. The exertion of\\r\\nattention, which is frequently required from them, is too great for\\r\\nthe patience of childhood: the words that are used are so inaccurate\\r\\nin their signification, that they convey to the mind sometimes one\\r\\nidea and sometimes another; we might as well require of them to cast\\r\\nup a sum right whilst we rubbed out and changed the figures every\\r\\ninstant, as expect that they should seize a combination of ideas\\r\\npresented to them in variable words. Whoever expects to command the\\r\\nattention of an intelligent child, must be extremely careful in the\\r\\nuse of words. If the pupil be paid for the labour of listening by the\\r\\npleasure of understanding what is said, he will attend, whether it be\\r\\nto his playfellow, or to his tutor, to conversation, or to books. But\\r\\nif he has by fatal experience discovered, that, let him listen ever so\\r\\nintently, he cannot understand, he will spare himself the trouble of\\r\\nfruitless exertion; and, though he may put on a face of attention, his\\r\\nthoughts will wander far from his tutor and his tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is impossible to fix the attention of children,\" exclaims the\\r\\ntutor; \"when this boy attends he can do any thing, but he will not\\r\\nattend for a single instant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! it is in vain to say he _will not_ attend; he _cannot_.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[7] Some of these lessons, and others by the authors, will shortly be\\r\\nprinted, and marked according to this method.\\r\\n\\r\\n[8] See Priestley\\'s History of Vision, vol. i. p. 51.\\r\\n\\r\\n[9] \"Art de Penser.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[10] See Condillac\\'s Art de Penser.

His own account of the business is\\r\\nthe best we can give.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They told me _Chou_ signifies a book, so that I thought whenever the\\r\\nword _Chou_ was pronounced, a book was the subject of discourse; not\\r\\nat all. Chou, the next time I heard it, I found signified _a tree_.\\r\\nNow I was to recollect Chou was a book, and a tree; but this amounted\\r\\nto nothing. Chou I found also expressed _great heats_. Chou is _to\\r\\nrelate_. Chou is _the Aurora_. Chou means _to be accustomed_. Chou\\r\\nexpresses the _loss of a wager_, &c. I should never have done were I\\r\\nto enumerate all its meanings******.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I recited my sermon at least fifty times to my servant before I spoke\\r\\nit in public; and yet I am told, though he continually corrected me,\\r\\nthat of the ten parts of the sermon (as the Chinese express\\r\\nthemselves) they hardly understood three. Fortunately the Chinese are\\r\\nwonderfully patient.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren are sometimes in the condition in which the Chinese found\\r\\nthemselves at this learned missionary\\'s sermon, and their patience\\r\\ndeserves to be equally commended. The difficulty of understanding the\\r\\nChinese Chou, strikes us immediately, and we sympathise with Pere\\r\\nBourgeois\\'s perplexity; yet, many words, which are in common use\\r\\namongst us, may perhaps be as puzzling to children. _Block_ (see\\r\\nJohnson\\'s Dictionary) signifies _a heavy piece of timber, a mass of\\r\\nmatter_. Block means _the wood on which hats are formed_. Block means\\r\\n_the wood on which criminals are beheaded_. Block is _a sea-term for\\r\\npulley_. Block is _an obstruction, a stop_; and, finally, Block means\\r\\n_a blockhead_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are in our language, ten meanings for _sweet_, ten for _open_,\\r\\ntwenty-two for _upon_, and sixty-three for _to fall_. Such are the\\r\\ndefects of language! But, whatever they may be, we cannot hope\\r\\nimmediately to see them reformed, because common consent, and\\r\\nuniversal custom, must combine to establish a new vocabulary. None but\\r\\nphilosophers could invent, and none but philosophers would adopt, a\\r\\nphilosophical language. The new philosophical language of chemistry\\r\\nwas received at first with some reluctance, even by chemists,\\r\\nnotwithstanding its obvious utility and elegance. Butter of antimony,\\r\\nand liver of sulphur, flowers of zinc, oil of vitriol, and spirit of\\r\\nsulphur by the bell, powder of algaroth, and salt of alembroth, may\\r\\nyet long retain their ancient titles amongst apothecaries. There does\\r\\nnot exist in the mineral kingdom either butter or oil, or yet flowers;\\r\\nthese treacherous names[13] are given to the most violent poisons, so\\r\\nthat there is no analogy to guide the understanding or the memory: but\\r\\nCustom has a prescriptive right to talk nonsense. The barbarous\\r\\nenigmatical jargon of the ancient adepts continued for above a century\\r\\nto be the only chemical language of men of science, notwithstanding\\r\\nthe prodigious labour to the memory, and confusion to the\\r\\nunderstanding, which it occasioned: they have but just now left off\\r\\ncalling one of their vessels for distilling, a death\\'s head, and\\r\\nanother a helmet. Capricious analogy with difficulty yields to\\r\\nrational arrangement. If such has been the slow progress of a\\r\\nphilosophical language amongst the learned, how can we expect to make\\r\\na general, or even a partial reformation amongst the ignorant? And it\\r\\nmay be asked, how can we in education attempt to teach in any but\\r\\ncustomary terms? There is no occasion to make any sudden or violent\\r\\nalteration in language; but a man who attempts to teach, will find it\\r\\nnecessary to select his terms with care, to define them with accuracy,\\r\\nand to abide by them with steadiness; thus he will make a\\r\\nphilosophical vocabulary for himself. Persons who want to puzzle and\\r\\nto deceive, always pursue a contrary practice; they use as great a\\r\\nvariety of unmeaning, or of ambiguous words, as they possibly can.[14]\\r\\nThat state juggler, Oliver Cromwell, excelled in this species of\\r\\neloquence; his speeches are models in their kind. Count Cagliostro,\\r\\nand the Countess de la Motte, were not his superiors in the power of\\r\\nbaffling the understanding. The ancient oracles, and the old books of\\r\\njudicial astrologers, and of alchymists, were contrived upon the same\\r\\nprinciples; in all these we are confounded by a multiplicity of words\\r\\nwhich convey a doubtful sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren, who have not the habit of listening to words without\\r\\nunderstanding them, yawn and writhe with manifest symptoms of disgust,\\r\\nwhenever they are compelled to hear sounds which convey no ideas to\\r\\ntheir minds. All supernumerary words should be avoided in cultivating\\r\\nthe power of attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common observation, that we can attend to but one thing at a time,\\r\\nshould never be forgotten by those who expect to succeed in the art of\\r\\nteaching. In teaching new terms, or new ideas, we must not produce a\\r\\nnumber at once. It is prudent to consider, that the actual progress\\r\\nmade in our business at one sitting is not of so much consequence, as\\r\\nthe desire left in the pupil\\'s mind to sit again. Now a child will be\\r\\nbetter pleased with himself, and with his tutor, if he acquire one\\r\\ndistinct idea from a lesson, than if he retained a confused notion of\\r\\ntwenty different things. Some people imagine, that as children appear\\r\\naverse to repetition, variety will amuse them. Variety, to a certain\\r\\ndegree, certainly relieves the mind; but then the objects which are\\r\\nvaried must not all be entirely new. Novelty and variety, joined,\\r\\nfatigue the mind. Either we remain passive at the show, or else we\\r\\nfatigue ourselves with ineffectual activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few years ago, a gentleman[15] brought two Eskimaux to London--he\\r\\nwished to amuse, and at the same time to astonish, them with the great\\r\\nmagnificence of the metropolis. For this purpose, after having\\r\\nequipped them like English gentlemen, he took them out one morning to\\r\\nwalk through the streets of London. They walked for several hours in\\r\\nsilence; they expressed neither pleasure nor admiration at any thing\\r\\nwhich they saw. When their walk was ended, they appeared uncommonly\\r\\nmelancholy and stupified. As soon as they got home, they sat down with\\r\\ntheir elbows upon their knees, and hid their faces between their\\r\\nhands. The only words they could be brought to utter, were, \"Too much\\r\\nsmoke--too much noise--too much houses--too much men--too much every\\r\\nthing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people who attend public lectures upon natural philosophy, with\\r\\nthe expectation of being much amused and instructed, go home with\\r\\nsensations similar to those of the poor Eskimaux; they feel that they\\r\\nhave had too much of every thing. The lecturer has not time to explain\\r\\nhis terms, or to repeat them till they are distinct in the memory of\\r\\nhis audience.[16] To children, every mode of instruction must be\\r\\nhurtful which fatigues attention; therefore, a skilful preceptor will,\\r\\nas much as possible, avoid the manner of teaching, to which the public\\r\\nlecturer is in some degree compelled by his situation. A private\\r\\npreceptor, who undertakes the instruction of several pupils in the\\r\\nsame family, will examine with care the different habits and tempers\\r\\nof his pupils; and he will have full leisure to adapt his instructions\\r\\npeculiarly to each.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some general observations which apply to all understandings;\\r\\nthese we shall first enumerate, and we may afterwards examine what\\r\\ndistinctions should be made for pupils of different tempers or\\r\\ndispositions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides distinctness and accuracy in the language which we use,\\r\\nbesides care to produce but few ideas or terms that are new in our\\r\\nfirst lessons, we must exercise attention only during very short\\r\\nperiods. In the beginning of every science pupils have much laborious\\r\\nwork; we should therefore allow them time; we should repress our own\\r\\nimpatience when they appear to be slow in comprehending reasons, or in\\r\\nseizing analogies. We often expect, that those whom we are teaching\\r\\nshould know some things intuitively, because these may have been so\\r\\nlong known to us that we forget how we learned them. We may from habit\\r\\nlearn to pass with extraordinary velocity from one idea to another.\\r\\n\"Some often repeated processes of reasoning or invention,\" says Mr.\\r\\nStewart, \"may be carried on so quickly in the mind, that we may not be\\r\\nconscious of them ourselves.\" Yet we easily convince ourselves that\\r\\nthis rapid facility of thought is purely the result of practice, by\\r\\nobserving the comparatively slow progress of our understandings in\\r\\nsubjects to which we have not been accustomed: the progress of the\\r\\nmind is there so slow, that we can count every step.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are disposed to think that those must be naturally slow and stupid,\\r\\nwho do not perceive the resemblances between objects which strike us,\\r\\nwe say, at the first glance. But what we call the first glance is\\r\\nfrequently the fiftieth: we have got the things completely by heart;\\r\\nall the parts are known to us, and we are at leisure to compare and\\r\\njudge. A reasonable preceptor will not expect from his pupils two\\r\\nefforts of attention at the same instant; he will not require them at\\r\\nonce to learn terms by heart, and to compare the objects which those\\r\\nterms represent; he will repeat his terms till they are thoroughly\\r\\nfixed in the memory; he will repeat his reasoning till the chain of\\r\\nideas is completely formed.\\r\\n\\r\\nRepetition makes all operations easy; even the fatigue of thinking\\r\\ndiminishes by habit. That we may not increase the labour of the mind\\r\\nunseasonably, we should watch for the moment when habit has made one\\r\\nlesson easy, and when we may go forward a new step. In teaching the\\r\\nchildren at the House of Industry at Munich to spin, Count Rumford\\r\\nwisely ordered that they should be made perfect in one motion before\\r\\nany other was shown to them: at first they were allowed only to move\\r\\nthe wheel by the treadle with their feet; when, after sufficient\\r\\npractice, the foot became perfect in its lesson, the hands were set to\\r\\nwork, and the children were allowed to begin to spin with coarse\\r\\nmaterials. It is said that these children made remarkable good\\r\\nspinners. Madame de Genlis applied the same principle in teaching\\r\\nAdela to play upon the harp.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first attempts to learn any new bodily exercise, as fencing or\\r\\ndancing, persons are not certain what muscles they must use, and what\\r\\nmay be left at rest; they generally employ those of which they have\\r\\nthe most ready command, but these may not always be the muscles which\\r\\nare really wanted in the new operation. The simplest thing appears\\r\\ndifficult, till, by practice, we have associated the various slight\\r\\nmotions which ought to be combined. We feel, that from want of use,\\r\\nour motions are not obedient to our will, and to supply this defect,\\r\\nwe exert more strength and activity than is requisite. \"It does not\\r\\nrequire strength; you need not use so much force; you need not take so\\r\\nmuch pains;\" we frequently say to those who are making the first\\r\\npainful awkward attempts at some simple operation. Can any thing\\r\\nappear more easy than knitting, when we look at the dexterous, rapid\\r\\nmotions of an experienced practitioner? But let a gentleman take up a\\r\\nlady\\'s knitting needles, and knitting appears to him, and to all the\\r\\nspectators, one of the most difficult and laborious operations\\r\\nimaginable. A lady who is learning to work with a tambour needle, puts\\r\\nher head down close to the tambour frame, the colour comes into her\\r\\nface, she strains her eyes, all her faculties are exerted, and perhaps\\r\\nshe works at the rate of three links a minute. A week afterwards,\\r\\nprobably, practice has made the work perfectly easy; the same lady\\r\\ngoes rapidly on with her work; she can talk and laugh, and perhaps\\r\\neven think, whilst she works. She has now discovered that a number of\\r\\nthe motions, and a great portion of that attention which she thought\\r\\nnecessary to this mighty operation, may be advantageously spared.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a similar manner, in the exercise of our minds upon subjects that\\r\\nare new to us, we generally exert more attention than is necessary or\\r\\nserviceable, and we consequently soon fatigue ourselves without any\\r\\nadvantage. Children, to whom many subjects are new, are often fatigued\\r\\nby these overstrained and misplaced efforts. In these circumstances, a\\r\\ntutor should relieve the attention by introducing indifferent subjects\\r\\nof conversation; he can, by showing no anxiety himself, either in his\\r\\nmanner or countenance, relieve his pupil from any apprehension of his\\r\\ndispleasure, or of his contempt; he can represent that the object\\r\\nbefore them is not a matter of life and death; that if the child does\\r\\nnot succeed in the first trials, he will not be disgraced in the\\r\\nopinion of any of his friends; that by perseverance he will certainly\\r\\nconquer the difficulty; that it is of little consequence whether he\\r\\nunderstands the thing in question to-day or to-morrow; these\\r\\nconsiderations will calm the over-anxious pupil\\'s agitation, and,\\r\\nwhether he succeed or not, he will not suffer such a degree of pain\\r\\nas to disgust him in his first attempts.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the command which we, by this prudent management, obtain over\\r\\nthe pupil\\'s mind, we shall also prevent him from acquiring any of\\r\\nthose awkward gestures and involuntary motions which are sometimes\\r\\npractised to relieve the pain of attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Darwin observes, that when we experience any disagreeable\\r\\nsensations, we endeavour to procure ourselves temporary relief by\\r\\nmotions of those muscles and limbs which are most habitually obedient\\r\\nto our will. This observation extends to mental as well as to bodily\\r\\npain; thus persons in violent grief wring their hands and convulse\\r\\ntheir countenances; those who are subject to the petty, but acute\\r\\nmiseries of false shame, endeavour to relieve themselves by awkward\\r\\ngestures and continual motions. A plough-boy, when he is brought into\\r\\nthe presence of those whom he thinks his superiors, endeavours to\\r\\nrelieve himself from the uneasy sensations of false shame, by twirling\\r\\nhis hat upon his fingers, and by various uncouth gestures. Men who\\r\\nthink a great deal, sometimes acquire habitual awkward gestures, to\\r\\nrelieve the pain of intense thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen attention first becomes irksome to children, they mitigate the\\r\\nmental pain by wrinkling their brows, or they fidget and put\\r\\nthemselves into strange attitudes. These odd motions, which at first\\r\\nare voluntary, after they have been frequently associated with certain\\r\\nstates of mind, constantly recur involuntarily with those feelings or\\r\\nideas with which they have been connected. For instance, a boy, who\\r\\nhas been used to buckle and unbuckle his shoe, when he repeats his\\r\\nlesson by rote, cannot repeat his lesson without performing this\\r\\noperation; it becomes a sort of artificial memory, which is necessary\\r\\nto prompt his recollective faculty. When children have a _variety_ of\\r\\ntricks of this sort, they are of little consequence; but when they\\r\\nhave acquired a few constant and habitual motions, whilst they think,\\r\\nor repeat, or listen, these should be attended to, and the habits\\r\\nshould be broken, otherwise these young people will appear, when they\\r\\ngrow up, awkward and ridiculous in their manners; and, what is worse,\\r\\nperhaps their thoughts and abilities will be too much in the power of\\r\\nexternal circumstances. Addison represents, with much humour, the case\\r\\nof a poor man who had the habit of twirling a bit of thread round his\\r\\nfinger; the thread was accidentally broken, and the orator stood mute.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe once saw a gentleman get up to speak in a public assembly, provided\\r\\nwith a paper of notes written in pencil: during the exordium of his\\r\\nspeech, he thumbed his notes with incessant agitation; when he looked\\r\\nat the paper, he found that the words were totally obliterated; he was\\r\\nobliged to apologize to his audience; and, after much hesitation, sat\\r\\ndown abashed. A father would be sorry to see his son in such a\\r\\npredicament.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo prevent children from acquiring such awkward tricks whilst they are\\r\\nthinking, we should in the first place take care not to make them\\r\\nattend for too long a time together, then the pain of attention will\\r\\nnot be so violent as to compel them to use these strange modes of\\r\\nrelief. Bodily exercise should immediately follow that entire state of\\r\\nrest, in which our pupils ought to keep themselves whilst they attend.\\r\\nThe first symptoms of any awkward trick should be watched; they are\\r\\neasily prevented by early care from becoming habitual. If any such\\r\\ntricks have been acquired, and if the pupil cannot exert his attention\\r\\nin common, unless certain contortions are permitted, we should attempt\\r\\nthe cure either by sudden slight bodily pain, or by a total suspension\\r\\nof all the employments with which these bad habits are associated. If\\r\\na boy could not read without swinging his head like a pendulum, we\\r\\nshould rather prohibit him from reading for some time, than suffer\\r\\nhim to grow up with this ridiculous habit. But in conversation,\\r\\nwhenever opportunities occur of telling him any thing in which he is\\r\\nparticularly interested, we should refuse to gratify his curiosity,\\r\\nunless he keeps himself perfectly still. The excitement here would be\\r\\nsufficient to conquer the habit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever is connected with pain or pleasure commands our attention;\\r\\nbut to make this general observation useful in education, we must\\r\\nexamine what degrees of stimulus are necessary for different pupils,\\r\\nand in different circumstances. We have formerly observed,[18] that it\\r\\nis not prudent early to use violent or continual stimulus, either of a\\r\\npainful or a pleasurable nature, to excite children to application,\\r\\nbecause we should by an intemperate use of these, weaken the mind, and\\r\\nbecause we may with a little patience obtain all we wish without these\\r\\nexpedients. Besides these reasons, there is another potent argument\\r\\nagainst using violent motives to excite attention; such motives\\r\\nfrequently disturb and dissipate the very attention which they attempt\\r\\nto fix. If a child be threatened with severe punishment, or flattered\\r\\nwith the promise of some delicious reward, in order to induce his\\r\\nperformance of any particular task, he desires instantly to perform\\r\\nthe task; but this desire will not ensure his success: unless he has\\r\\npreviously acquired the habit of voluntary exertion, he will not be\\r\\nable to turn his mind from his ardent wishes, even to the means of\\r\\naccomplishing them. He will be in the situation of Alnaschar in the\\r\\nArabian tales, who, whilst he dreamt of his future grandeur, forgot\\r\\nhis immediate business. The greater his hope or fear, the greater the\\r\\ndifficulty of his employing himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo teach any new habit or art, we must not employ any alarming\\r\\nexcitements: small, certain, regularly recurring motives, which\\r\\ninterest, but which do not distract the mind, are evidently the best.\\r\\nThe ancient inhabitants of Minorca were said to be the best slingers\\r\\nin the world; when they were children, every morning what they were to\\r\\neat was slightly suspended from high poles, and they were obliged to\\r\\nthrow down their breakfasts with their slings from the places where\\r\\nthey were suspended, before they could satisfy their hunger. The\\r\\nmotive seems to have been here well proportioned to the effect that\\r\\nwas required; it could not be any great misfortune to a boy to go\\r\\nwithout his breakfast; but as this motive returned every morning, it\\r\\nbecame sufficiently serious to the hungry slingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is impossible to explain this subject so as to be of use, without\\r\\ndescending to minute particulars. When a mother says to her little\\r\\ndaughter, as she places on the table before her a bunch of ripe\\r\\ncherries, \"Tell me, my dear, how many cherries are there, and I will\\r\\ngive them to you?\" The child\\'s attention is fixed instantly; there is\\r\\na sufficient motive, not a motive which excites any violent passions,\\r\\nbut which raises just such a degree of hope as is necessary to produce\\r\\nattention. The little girl, if she knows from experience that her\\r\\nmother\\'s promise will be kept, and that her own patience is likely to\\r\\nsucceed, counts the cherries carefully, has her reward, and upon the\\r\\nnext similar trial she will, from this success, be still more disposed\\r\\nto exert her attention. The pleasure of eating cherries, associated\\r\\nwith the pleasure of success, will balance the pain of a few moments\\r\\nprolonged application, and by degrees the cherries may be withdrawn,\\r\\nthe association of pleasure will remain. Objects or thoughts, that\\r\\nhave been associated with pleasure, retain the power of pleasing; as\\r\\nthe needle touched by the loadstone acquires polarity, and retains it\\r\\nlong after the loadstone is withdrawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever attention is habitually raised by the power of association,\\r\\nwe should be careful to withdraw all the excitements that were\\r\\noriginally used, because these are now unnecessary; and, as we have\\r\\nformerly observed, the steady rule, with respect to stimulus, should\\r\\nbe to give the least possible quantity that will produce the effect we\\r\\nwant. Success is a great pleasure; as soon as children become sensible\\r\\nto this pleasure, that is to say, when they have tasted it two or\\r\\nthree times, they will exert their attention merely with the hope of\\r\\nsucceeding. We have seen a little boy of three years old, frowning\\r\\nwith attention for several minutes together, whilst he was trying to\\r\\nclasp and unclasp a lady\\'s bracelet; his whole soul was intent upon\\r\\nthe business; he neither saw nor heard any thing else that passed in\\r\\nthe room, though several people were talking, and some happened to be\\r\\nlooking at him. The pleasure of success, when he clasped the bracelet,\\r\\nwas quite sufficient; he looked for no praise, though he was perhaps\\r\\npleased with the sympathy that was shown in his success. Sympathy is a\\r\\nbetter reward for young children in such circumstances than praise,\\r\\nbecause it does not excite vanity, and it is connected with benevolent\\r\\nfeelings; besides, it is not so violent a stimulus as applause.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of increasing excitements to produce attention, we may vary\\r\\nthem, which will have just the same effect. When sympathy fails, try\\r\\ncuriosity; when curiosity fails, try praise; when praise begins to\\r\\nlose its effect, try blame; and when you go back again to sympathy,\\r\\nyou will find that, after this interval, it will have recovered all\\r\\nits original power. Doctor Darwin, who has the happy art of\\r\\nillustrating, from the most familiar circumstances in real life, the\\r\\nabstract theories of philosophy, gives us the following picturesque\\r\\ninstance of the use of varying motives to prolong exertion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little boy, who was tired of walking, begged of his papa to carry\\r\\nhim. \"Here,\" says the reverend doctor, \"ride upon my gold headed\\r\\ncane;\" and the pleased child, putting it between his legs, galloped\\r\\naway with delight. Here the aid of another sensorial power, that of\\r\\npleasurable sensation, superadded power to exhausted volition, which\\r\\ncould otherwise only have been excited by additional pain, as by the\\r\\nlash of slavery.\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlexander the Great one day saw a poor man carrying upon his shoulders\\r\\na heavy load of silver for the royal camp: the man tottered under his\\r\\nburden, and was ready to give up the point from fatigue. \"Hold on,\\r\\nfriend, the rest of the way, and carry it to your own tent, for it is\\r\\nyours,\" said Alexander.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some people, who have the power of exciting others to great\\r\\nmental exertions, not by the promise of specific rewards, or by the\\r\\nthreats of any punishment, but by the ardent ambition which they\\r\\ninspire, by the high value which is set upon their love and esteem.\\r\\nWhen we have formed a high opinion of a friend, his approbation\\r\\nbecomes necessary to our own self-complacency, and we think no labour\\r\\ntoo great to satisfy our attachment. Our exertions are not fatiguing,\\r\\nbecause they are associated with all the pleasurable sensations of\\r\\naffection, self-complacency, benevolence, and liberty. These feelings,\\r\\nin youth, produce all the virtuous enthusiasm characteristic of great\\r\\nminds; even childhood is capable of it in some degree, as those\\r\\nparents well know, who have never enjoyed the attachment of a grateful\\r\\naffectionate child. Those, who neglect to cultivate the affections of\\r\\ntheir pupils, will never be able to excite them to \"noble ends,\" by\\r\\n\"noble means.\" Theirs will be the dominion of fear, from which reason\\r\\nwill emancipate herself, and from which pride will yet more certainly\\r\\nrevolt.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Henry the Fourth of France had been reduced, like Dionysius the\\r\\ntyrant of Syracuse, to earn his bread as a schoolmaster, what a\\r\\ndifferent preceptor he would probably have made! Dionysius must have\\r\\nbeen hated by his scholars as much as by his subjects, for it is said,\\r\\nthat \"he[20] practised upon children that tyranny which he could no\\r\\nlonger exercise over men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ambassador, who found Henry the Fourth playing upon the carpet\\r\\nwith his children, would probably have trusted his own children, if he\\r\\nhad any, to the care of such an affectionate tutor.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry the Fourth would have attached his pupils whilst he instructed\\r\\nthem; they would have exerted themselves because they could not have\\r\\nbeen happy without his esteem. Henry\\'s courtiers, or rather his\\r\\nfriends, for though he was a king he had friends, sometimes expressed\\r\\nsurprise at their own disinterestedness: \"This king pays us with\\r\\nwords,\" said they, \"and yet we are satisfied!\" Sully, when he was only\\r\\nBaron de Rosny, and before he had any hopes of being a duke, was once\\r\\nin a passion with the king his master, and half resolved to leave him:\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t know how it was,\" says the honest minister, \"with all his\\r\\nfaults, there is something about Henry which I found I could not\\r\\nleave; and when I met him again, a few words made me forget all my\\r\\ncauses of discontent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren are more easily attached than courtiers, and full as easily\\r\\nrewarded. When once this generous desire of affection and esteem is\\r\\nraised in the mind, their exertions seem to be universal and\\r\\nspontaneous: children are then no longer like machines, which require\\r\\nto be wound up regularly to perform certain revolutions; they are\\r\\nanimated with a living principle, which directs all that it inspires.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have endeavoured to point out the general excitements, and the\\r\\ngeneral precautions, to be used in cultivating the power of attention;\\r\\nit may be expected, that we should more particularly apply these to\\r\\nthe characters of different pupils. We shall not here examine whether\\r\\nthere be any original difference of character or intellect, because\\r\\nthis would lead into a wide theoretical discussion; a difference in\\r\\nthe temper and talents of children early appears, and some practical\\r\\nremarks may be of service to correct defects, or to improve abilities,\\r\\nwhether we suppose them to be natural or acquired. The first\\r\\ndifferences which a preceptor observes between his pupils, when he\\r\\nbegins to teach them, are perhaps scarcely marked so strongly as to\\r\\nstrike the careless spectator; but in a few years these varieties are\\r\\napparent to every eye. This seems to prove, that during the interval\\r\\nthe power of education has operated strongly to increase the original\\r\\npropensities. The quick and slow, the timid and presumptuous, should\\r\\nbe early instructed so as to correct as much as possible their several\\r\\ndefects.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manner in which children are first instructed must tend either to\\r\\nincrease or diminish their timidity, or their confidence in\\r\\nthemselves, to encourage them to undertake great things, or to rest\\r\\ncontent with limited acquirements. Young people, who have found from\\r\\nexperience, that they cannot remember or understand one half of what\\r\\nis forced upon their attention, become extremely diffident of their\\r\\nown capacity, and they will not undertake as much even as they are\\r\\nable to perform. With timid tempers, we should therefore begin, by\\r\\nexpecting but little from each effort, but whatever is attempted,\\r\\nshould be certainly within their attainment; success will encourage\\r\\nthe most stupid humility. It should be carefully pointed out to\\r\\ndiffident children, that attentive patience can do as much as\\r\\nquickness of intellect. If they perceive that time makes all the\\r\\ndifference between the quick and the slow, they will be induced to\\r\\npersevere. The transition of attention from one subject to another is\\r\\ndifficult to some children, to others it is easy. If all be expected\\r\\nto do the same things in an equal period of time, the slow will\\r\\nabsolutely give up the competition; but, on the contrary, if they are\\r\\nallowed time, they will accomplish their purposes. We have been\\r\\nconfirmed in our belief of this doctrine by experiments. The same\\r\\nproblems have been frequently given to children of different degrees\\r\\nof quickness, and though some succeeded much more quickly than others,\\r\\nall the individuals in the family have persevered till they have\\r\\nsolved the questions; and the timid seem to have been more encouraged\\r\\nby this practical demonstration of the infallibility of persevering\\r\\nattention, than by any other methods which have been tried. When,\\r\\nafter a number of small successful trials, they have acquired some\\r\\nshare of confidence in themselves, when they are certain of the\\r\\npossibility of their performing any given operations, we may then\\r\\npress them a little as to velocity. When they are well acquainted with\\r\\nany set of ideas, we may urge them to quick transition of attention\\r\\nfrom one to another; but if we insist upon this rapidity of\\r\\ntransition, before they are thoroughly acquainted with each idea in\\r\\nthe assemblage, we shall only increase their timidity and hesitation;\\r\\nwe shall confound their understandings, and depress their ambition.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is of consequence to distinguish between slow and sluggish\\r\\nattention. Sometimes children appear stupid and heavy, when they are\\r\\nabsolutely exhausted by too great efforts of attention: at other\\r\\ntimes, they have something like the same dulness of aspect, before\\r\\nthey have had any thing to fatigue them, merely from their not having\\r\\nyet awakened themselves to business. We must be certain of our pupil\\'s\\r\\nstate of mind before we proceed. If he be incapacitated from fatigue,\\r\\nlet him rest; if he be torpid, rouse him with a rattling peal of\\r\\nthunder; but be sure that you have not, as it has been said of\\r\\nJupiter,[21] recourse to your thunder only when you are in the wrong.\\r\\nSome preceptors scold when they cannot explain, and grow angry in\\r\\nproportion to the fatigue they see expressed in the countenance of\\r\\ntheir unhappy pupils. If a timid child foresees that an explanation\\r\\nwill probably end in a phillipic, he cannot fix his attention; he is\\r\\nanticipating the evil of your anger, instead of listening to your\\r\\ndemonstrations; and he says, \"Yes, yes, I see, I know, I understand,\"\\r\\nwith trembling eagerness, whilst through the mist and confusion of his\\r\\nfears, he can scarcely see or hear, much less understand, any thing.\\r\\nIf you mistake the confusion and fatigue of terror for inattention or\\r\\nindolence, and press your pupil to further exertions, you will\\r\\nconfirm, instead of curing, his stupidity. You must diminish his fear\\r\\nbefore you can increase his attention. With children who are thus,\\r\\nfrom timid anxiety to please, disposed to exert their faculties too\\r\\nmuch, it is obvious that no excitation should be used, but every\\r\\nplayful, every affectionate means should be employed to dissipate\\r\\ntheir apprehensions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is more difficult to manage with those who have sluggish, than with\\r\\nthose who have timid, attention. Indolent children have not usually so\\r\\nlively a taste for pleasure as others have; they do not seem to hear\\r\\nor see so quickly; they are content with a little enjoyment; they have\\r\\nscarcely any ambition; they seem to prefer ease to all sorts of glory;\\r\\nthey have little voluntary exertion; and the pain of attention is to\\r\\nthem so great, that they would preferably endure the pain of shame,\\r\\nand of all the accumulated punishments which are commonly devised for\\r\\nthem by the vengeance of their exasperated tutors. Locke notices this\\r\\nlistless, lazy humour in children; he classes it under the head\\r\\n\"Sauntering;\" and he divides saunterers into two species; those who\\r\\nsaunter only at their books and tasks; and those who saunter at play\\r\\nand every thing. The book-saunterers have only an acute, the others\\r\\nhave a chronic disease; the one is easily cured, the other disease\\r\\nwill cost more time and pains.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, by some unlucky management, a vivacious child acquires a dislike\\r\\nto literary application, he may appear at his books with all the\\r\\nstupid apathy of a dunce. In this state of literary dereliction, we\\r\\nshould not force books and tasks of any sort upon him; we should\\r\\nrather watch him when he is eager at amusements of his own selection,\\r\\nobserve to what his attention turns, and cultivate his attention upon\\r\\nthat subject, whatever it may be. He may be led to think, and to\\r\\nacquire knowledge upon a variety of subjects, without sitting down to\\r\\nread; and thus he may form habits of attention and application, which\\r\\nwill be associated with pleasure. When he returns to books, he will\\r\\nfind that he understands a variety of things in them which before\\r\\nappeared incomprehensible; they will \"give him back the image of his\\r\\nmind,\" and he will like them as he likes pictures.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs long as a child shows energy upon any occasion, there is hope. If\\r\\nhe \"lend his little soul\"[22] to whipping a top, there is no danger of\\r\\nhis being a dunce. When Alcibiades was a child, he was one day playing\\r\\nat dice with other boys in the street; a loaded waggon came up just as\\r\\nit was his turn to throw. At first he called to the driver to stop,\\r\\nbut the waggoner would not stop his horses; all the boys, except\\r\\nAlcibiades, ran away, but Alcibiades threw himself upon his face,\\r\\ndirectly before the horses, and stretching himself out, bid the\\r\\nwaggoner drive on if he pleased. Perhaps, at the time when he showed\\r\\nthis energy about a game at dice, Alcibiades might have been a\\r\\nsaunterer at his book, and a foolish schoolmaster might have made him\\r\\na dunce.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocke advises that children, who are too much addicted to what is\\r\\ncalled play, should be surfeited with it, that they may return to\\r\\nbusiness with a better appetite. But this advice supposes that play\\r\\nhas been previously interdicted, or that it is something pernicious:\\r\\nwe have endeavoured to show that play is nothing but a change of\\r\\nemployment, and that the attention may be exercised advantageously\\r\\nupon a variety of subjects which are not called Tasks.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith those who show chronic listlessness, Locke advises that we should\\r\\nuse every sort of stimulus; praise, amusement, fine clothes, eating;\\r\\nany thing that will make them bestir themselves. He argues, that as\\r\\nthere appears a deficiency of vigour, we have no reason to fear excess\\r\\nof appetite for any of these things: nay, further still, where none\\r\\nof these will act, he advises compulsory bodily exercise. If we\\r\\ncannot, he says, make sure of the invisible attention of the mind, we\\r\\nmay at least get something done, prevent the habit of total idleness,\\r\\nand perhaps make the children desire to exchange labour of body for\\r\\nlabour of mind. These expedients will, we fear, be found rather\\r\\npalliative than effectual; if, by forcing children to bodily exercise,\\r\\nthat becomes disagreeable, they may prefer labour of the mind; but, in\\r\\nmaking this exchange, or bargain, they are sensible that they choose\\r\\nthe least of two evils. The evil of application is diminished only by\\r\\ncomparison in their estimation; they will avoid it whenever they are\\r\\nat liberty. The love of eating, of fine clothes, &c. if they stimulate\\r\\na slothful child, must be the ultimate object of his exertions; he\\r\\nwill consider the performance of his task merely as a painful\\r\\ncondition on his part. Still the association of pain with literature\\r\\ncontinues; it is then impossible that he should love it. There is no\\r\\nactive principle within him, no desire for knowledge excited; his\\r\\nattention is forced, it ceases the moment the external force is\\r\\nwithdrawn. He drudges to earn his cream bowl duly set, but he will\\r\\nstretch his lubbar length the moment his task is done.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is another class of children opposed to saunterers, whom we may\\r\\ndenominate volatile geniuses. They show a vast deal of quickness and\\r\\nvivacity; they understand almost before a tutor can put his ideas into\\r\\nwords; they observe a variety of objects, but they do not connect\\r\\ntheir observations, and the very rapidity with which they seize an\\r\\nexplanation, prevents them from thoroughly comprehending it; they are\\r\\neasily disturbed by external objects when they are thinking. As they\\r\\nhave great sensibility, their associations are strong and various;\\r\\ntheir thoughts branch off into a thousand beautiful, but useless\\r\\nramifications. Whilst you are attempting to instruct them upon one\\r\\nsubject, they are inventing, perhaps, upon another; or they are\\r\\nfollowing a train of ideas suggested by something you have said, but\\r\\nforeign to your business. They are more pleased with the discovery of\\r\\nresemblances, than with discrimination of difference; the one costs\\r\\nthem more time and attention than the other: they are apt to say witty\\r\\nthings, and to strike out sparks of invention; but they have not\\r\\ncommonly the patience to form exact judgments, or to bring their first\\r\\ninventions to perfection. When they begin the race, every body expects\\r\\nthat they should outstrip all competitors; but it is often seen that\\r\\nslower rivals reach the goal before them. The predictions formed of\\r\\npupils of this temperament, vary much, according to the characters of\\r\\ntheir tutors. A slow man is provoked by their dissipated vivacity,\\r\\nand, unable to catch or fix their attention, prognosticates that they\\r\\nwill never have sufficient application to learn any thing. This\\r\\nprophecy, under certain tuition, would probably be accomplished. The\\r\\nwant of sympathy between a slow tutor and a quick child, is a great\\r\\ndisadvantage to both; each insists upon going his own pace, and his\\r\\nown way, and these ways are perhaps diametrically opposite. Even in\\r\\nforming a judgment of the child\\'s attention, the tutor, who is not\\r\\nacquainted with the manner in which his pupil goes to work, is liable\\r\\nto frequent mistakes. Children are sometimes suspected of not having\\r\\nlistened to what has been said to them, when they cannot exactly\\r\\nrepeat the words that they have heard; they often ask questions, and\\r\\nmake observations, which seem quite foreign to the present business;\\r\\nbut this is not always a proof that their minds are absent, or that\\r\\ntheir attention is dissipated. Their answers often appear to be far\\r\\nfrom the point, because they suppress their intermediate ideas, and\\r\\ngive only the result of their thoughts. This may be inconvenient to\\r\\nthose who teach them; but this habit sufficiently proves that these\\r\\nchildren are not deficient in attention. To cure them of the fault\\r\\nwhich they have, we should not accuse them falsely of another. But it\\r\\nmay be questioned whether this be a fault; it is absolutely necessary,\\r\\nin many processes of the mind, to suppress a number of intermediate\\r\\nideas. Life, if this were not practised, would be too short for those\\r\\nwho think, and much too short for those who speak. When somebody asked\\r\\nPyrrhus which of two musicians he liked the best, he answered,\\r\\n\"Polysperchon is the best general.\" This would appear to be the absurd\\r\\nanswer of an absent person, or of a fool, if we did not consider the\\r\\nideas that are implied, as well as those which are expressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 5th, 1796. To-day, at dinner, a lady observed that Nicholson,\\r\\nWilliamson, Jackson, &c. were names which originally meant the sons of\\r\\nNicholas, William, Jack, &c. A boy who was present, H----, added, with\\r\\na very grave face, as soon as she had finished speaking, \"Yes, ma\\'am,\\r\\nTydides.\" His mother asked him what he could mean by this absent\\r\\nspeech? H---- calmly repeated, \"Ma\\'am, yes; because I think it is like\\r\\nTydides.\" His brother S----eagerly interposed, to supply the\\r\\nintermediate ideas; \"Yes, indeed, mother,\" cried he, \"H---- is not\\r\\nabsent, because _des_, in Greek, means _the son of_ (the race of.)\\r\\nTydides is the son of Tydeus, as Jackson is the son of Jack.\" In this\\r\\ninstance, H---- was not absent, though he did not make use of a\\r\\nsufficient number of words to explain his ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust, 1796. L----, when he returned home, after some months absence,\\r\\nentertained his brothers and sisters with a new play, which he had\\r\\nlearned at Edinburgh. He told them, that when he struck the table with\\r\\nhis hand, every person present, was instantaneously to remain fixed in\\r\\nthe attitudes in which they should be when the blow was given. The\\r\\nattitudes in which some of the little company were fixed, occasioned\\r\\nmuch diversion; but in speaking of this new play afterwards, they had\\r\\nno name for it. Whilst they were thinking of a name for it, H----\\r\\nexclaimed, \"The Gorgon!\" It was immediately agreed that this was a\\r\\ngood name for the play, and H----, upon this occasion, was perfectly\\r\\nintelligible, without expressing all the intermediate ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood judges, form an accurate estimate of the abilities of those who\\r\\nconverse with them, by what they omit, as well as by what they say. If\\r\\nany one can show that he also has been in Arcadia, he is sure of being\\r\\nwell received, without producing minutes of his journey. In the same\\r\\nmanner we should judge of children; if they arrive at certain\\r\\nconclusions in reasoning, we may be satisfied that they have taken all\\r\\nthe necessary previous steps. We need not question their attention\\r\\nupon subjects where they give proofs of invention; they must have\\r\\nremembered well, or they could not invent; they must have attended\\r\\nwell, or they could not have remembered. Nothing wearies a quick child\\r\\nmore than to be forced slowly to retrace his own thoughts, and to\\r\\nrepeat the words of a discourse to prove that he has listened to it. A\\r\\ntutor, who is slow in understanding the ideas of his vivacious pupil,\\r\\ngives him so much trouble and pain, that he grows silent, from finding\\r\\nit not worth while to speak. It is for this reason, that children\\r\\nappear stupid and silent, with some people, and sprightly and\\r\\ntalkative with others. Those who hope to talk to children with any\\r\\neffect, must, as Rousseau observes, be able to hear as well as to\\r\\nspeak. M. de Segrais, who was deaf, was much in the right to decline\\r\\nbeing preceptor to the Duke de Maine. A deaf preceptor would certainly\\r\\nmake a child dumb.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo win the attention of vivacious children, we must sometimes follow\\r\\nthem in their zigzag course, and even press them to the end of their\\r\\nown train of thought. They will be content when they have obtained a\\r\\nfull hearing; then they will have leisure to discover that what they\\r\\nwere in such haste to utter, was not so well worth saying as they\\r\\nimagined; that their bright ideas often, when steadily examined by\\r\\nthemselves, fade into absurdities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where does this path lead to? Can\\'t we get over this stile? May I\\r\\n_only_ go into this wood?\" exclaims an active child, when he is taken\\r\\nout to walk. Every path appears more delightful than the straight\\r\\nroad; but let him try the paths, they will perhaps end in\\r\\ndisappointment, and then his imagination will be corrected. Let him\\r\\ntry his own experiments, then he will be ready to try yours; and if\\r\\nyours succeed better than his own, you will secure his confidence.\\r\\nAfter a child has talked on for some time, till he comes to the end of\\r\\nhis ideas, then he will perhaps listen to what you have to say; and if\\r\\nhe finds it better than what he has been saying himself, he will\\r\\nvoluntarily give you his attention the next time you begin to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nVivacious children are peculiarly susceptible of blame and praise; we\\r\\nhave, therefore, great power over their attachment, if we manage these\\r\\nexcitements properly. These children should not be praised for their\\r\\n_happy hits_, their first[24] glances should not be extolled; but, on\\r\\nthe contrary, they should be rewarded with universal approbation when\\r\\nthey give proofs of patient industry, when they bring any thing to\\r\\nperfection. No one can bring any thing to perfection without long\\r\\ncontinued attention; and industry and perseverance presuppose\\r\\nattention. Proofs of any of these qualities may therefore satisfy us\\r\\nas to the pupil\\'s capacity and habits of attention; we need not stand\\r\\nby to see the attention exercised, the things produced are sufficient\\r\\nevidence. Buffon tells us that he wrote his Epoques de la Nature over\\r\\neighteen times before he could perfect it to his taste. The high\\r\\nfinish of his composition is sufficient evidence to intelligent\\r\\nreaders, that he exerted long continued attention upon the work; they\\r\\ndo not require to have the eighteen copies produced.\\r\\n\\r\\nBacon supposes, that for every disease of the mind, specific remedies\\r\\nmight be found in appropriate studies and exercises. Thus, for\\r\\n\"bird-witted\" children he prescribes the study of mathematics,\\r\\nbecause, in mathematical studies, the attention must be fixed; the\\r\\nleast intermission of thought breaks the whole chain of reasoning,\\r\\ntheir labour is lost, and they must begin their demonstration again.\\r\\nThis principle is excellent; but to apply it advantageously, we should\\r\\nchoose moments when a mathematical demonstration is interesting to\\r\\nchildren, else we have not sufficient motive to excite them to\\r\\ncommence the demonstration; they will perceive, that they loose all\\r\\ntheir labour if their attention is interrupted; but how shall we make\\r\\nthem begin to attend? There are a variety of subjects which are\\r\\ninteresting to children, to which we may apply Bacon\\'s principle; for\\r\\ninstance, a child is eager to hear a story which you are going to tell\\r\\nhim; you may exercise his attention by your manner of telling this\\r\\nstory; you may employ with advantage the beautiful figure of speech\\r\\ncalled _suspension_: but you must take care, that the hope which is\\r\\nlong deferred be at last gratified. The young critics will look back\\r\\nwhen your story is finished, and will examine whether their attention\\r\\nhas been wasted, or whether all the particulars to which it was\\r\\ndirected were essential. Though in amusing stories we recommend the\\r\\nfigure called suspension,[25] we do not recommend its use in\\r\\nexplanations. Our explanations should be put into as few words as\\r\\npossible: the closer the connection of ideas, the better. When we say,\\r\\nallow time to understand your explanations, we mean, allow time\\r\\nbetween each idea, do not fill up the interval with words. Never, by\\r\\nway of gaining time, pay in sixpences; this is the last resource of a\\r\\nbankrupt.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe formerly observed that a preceptor, in his first lessons on any new\\r\\nsubject, must submit to the drudgery of repeating his terms and his\\r\\nreasoning, until these are sufficiently familiar to his pupils. He\\r\\nmust, however, proportion the number of his repetitions to the temper\\r\\nand habits of his pupils, else he will weary, instead of\\r\\nstrengthening, the attention. When a thing is clear, let him never try\\r\\nto make it clearer; when a thing is understood, not a word more of\\r\\nexemplification should be added. To mark precisely the moment when the\\r\\npupil understands what is said, the moment when he is master of the\\r\\nnecessary ideas, and, consequently, the moment when repetition should\\r\\ncease, is, perhaps, the most difficult thing in the art of teaching.\\r\\nThe countenance, the eye, the voice, and manner of the pupil, mark\\r\\nthis instant to an observing preceptor; but a preceptor, who is\\r\\nabsorbed in his own ideas, will never think of looking in his pupil\\'s\\r\\nface; he will go on with his routine of explanation, whilst his once\\r\\nlively, attentive pupil, exhibits opposite to him the picture of\\r\\nstupified fatigue. Quick, intelligent children, who have frequently\\r\\nfound that lessons are reiterated by a patient but injudicious tutor,\\r\\nwill learn a careless mode of listening at intervals; they will say to\\r\\nthemselves, \"Oh I shall hear this again!\" And if any stray thought\\r\\ncomes across their minds, they will not scruple to amuse themselves,\\r\\nand will afterwards ask for a repetition of the words or ideas which\\r\\nthey missed during this excursion of fancy. When they hear the warning\\r\\nadvertisement of \"certainly for the last time this season,\" they will\\r\\ndeem it time enough to attend to the performance. To cure them of this\\r\\npresumption in favour of our patience, and of their own superlative\\r\\nquickness, we should press that quickness to its utmost speed.\\r\\nWhenever we call for their attention, let it be on subjects highly\\r\\ninteresting or amusing, and let us give them but just sufficient time\\r\\nwith their fullest exertion to catch our words and ideas. As these\\r\\nquick gentlemen are proud of their rapidity of apprehension, this\\r\\nmethod will probably secure their attention, they will dread the\\r\\ndisgrace of not understanding what is said, and they will feel that\\r\\nthey cannot understand unless they exert prompt, vigorous, unremitted\\r\\nattention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duchess of Kingston used to complain that she could never acquire\\r\\nany knowledge, because she never could meet with any body who could\\r\\nteach her anything \"in two words.\" Her Grace felt the same sort of\\r\\nimpatience which was expressed by the tyrant who expected to find a\\r\\nroyal road to Geometry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who believe themselves endowed with genius, expect to find a\\r\\nroyal road in every science shorter, and less laborious, than the\\r\\nbeaten paths of industry. Their expectations are usually in proportion\\r\\nto their ignorance; they see to the summit only of one hill, and they\\r\\ndo not suspect the Alps that will arise as they advance: but as\\r\\nchildren become less presumptuous, as they acquire more knowledge, we\\r\\nmay bear with their juvenile impatience, whilst we take measures to\\r\\nenlarge continually their sphere of information. We should not,\\r\\nhowever, humour the attention of young people, by teaching them always\\r\\nin the mode which we know suits their temper best. Vivacious pupils\\r\\nshould, from time to time, be accustomed to an exact enumeration of\\r\\nparticulars; and we should take opportunities to convince them, that\\r\\nan orderly connection of proofs, and a minute observation of apparent\\r\\ntrifles, are requisite to produce the lively descriptions, great\\r\\ndiscoveries, and happy inventions, which pupils of this disposition\\r\\nare ever prone to admire with enthusiasm. They will learn not to pass\\r\\nover _old_ things, when they perceive that these may lead to something\\r\\n_new_; and they will even submit to sober attention, when they feel\\r\\nthat this is necessary even to the rapidity of genius. In the\\r\\n\"Curiosities of Literature,\" there has been judiciously preserved a\\r\\ncurious instance of literary patience; the rough draught of that\\r\\nbeautiful passage in Pope\\'s translation of the Iliad which describes\\r\\nthe parting of Hector and Andromache. The lines are in Pope\\'s\\r\\nhand-writing, and his numerous corrections appear; the lines which\\r\\nseem to the reader to have been struck off at a single happy stroke,\\r\\nare proved to have been touched and retouched with the indefatigable\\r\\nattention of a great writer. The fragment, with all its climax of\\r\\ncorrections, was shown to a young vivacious poet of nine years old, as\\r\\na practical lesson, to prove the necessity of patience to arrive at\\r\\nperfection. Similar examples, from real life, should be produced to\\r\\nyoung people at proper times; the testimony of men of acknowledged\\r\\nabilities, of men whom they have admired for genius, will come with\\r\\npeculiar force in favour of application. Parents, well acquainted with\\r\\nliterature, cannot be at a loss to find opposite illustrations. The\\r\\nLife of Franklin is an excellent example of persevering industry; the\\r\\nvariations in different editions of Voltaire\\'s dramatic poetry, and in\\r\\nPope\\'s works, are worth examining. All Sir Joshua Reynolds\\'s eloquent\\r\\nacademical discourses enforce the doctrine of patience; when he wants\\r\\nto prove to painters the value of continual energetic attention, he\\r\\nquotes from Livy the character of Philopoemen, one of the ablest\\r\\ngenerals of antiquity. So certain it is, that the same principle\\r\\npervades all superior minds: whatever may be their pursuits, attention\\r\\nis the avowed primary cause of their success. These examples from the\\r\\ndead, should be well supported by examples from amongst the living. In\\r\\ncommon life, occurrences can frequently be pointed out, in which\\r\\nattention and application are amply rewarded with success.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will encourage those who are interested in education, to observe,\\r\\nthat two of the most difficult exercises of the mind can, by\\r\\npractice, be rendered familiar, even by persons whom we do not\\r\\nconsider as possessed of superior talents. Abstraction and\\r\\ntransition--abstraction, the power of withdrawing the attention from\\r\\nall external objects, and concentrating it upon some particular set of\\r\\nideas, we admire as one of the most difficult exercises of the\\r\\nphilosopher. Abstraction was formerly considered as such a difficult\\r\\nand painful operation, that it required perfect silence and solitude;\\r\\nmany ancient philosophers quarrelled with their senses, and shut\\r\\nthemselves up in caves, to secure their attention from the\\r\\ndistraction caused by external objects. But modern[26] philosophers\\r\\nhave discovered, that neither caves nor lamps are essential to the\\r\\nfull and successful exercise of their mental powers. Persons of\\r\\nordinary abilities, tradesmen and shop-keepers, in the midst of the\\r\\ntumult of a public city, in the noise of rumbling carts and rattling\\r\\ncarriages, amidst the voices of a multitude of people talking upon\\r\\nvarious subjects, amidst the provoking interruptions of continual\\r\\nquestions and answers, and in the broad glare of a hot sun, can\\r\\ncommand and abstract their attention so far as to calculate yards,\\r\\nells, and nails, to cast up long sums in addition right to a farthing,\\r\\nand to make out multifarious bills with quick and unerring precision.\\r\\nIn almost all the dining houses at Vienna, as a late traveller[27]\\r\\ninforms us \"a bill of fare containing a vast collection of dishes is\\r\\nwritten out, and the prices are affixed to each article. As the people\\r\\nof Vienna are fond of variety, the calculation at the conclusion of a\\r\\nrepast would appear somewhat embarrassing; this, however, is done by\\r\\nmechanical habit with great speed; the custom is for the party who has\\r\\ndined to name the dishes, and the quantity of bread and wine. The\\r\\nkeller who attends on this occasion, follows every article you name\\r\\nwith the sum, which this adds to the calculation, and the whole is\\r\\nperformed, to whatever amount, without ink or paper. It is curious to\\r\\nhear this ceremony, which is muttered with great gravity, yet\\r\\nperformed with accuracy and despatch.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe coolly observe, when we read these things, \"Yes, this is all habit;\\r\\nany body who had used himself to it might do the same things.\" Yet the\\r\\nvery same power of abstracting the attention, when employed upon\\r\\nscientific and literary subjects, would excite our astonishment; and\\r\\nwe should, perhaps, immediately attribute it to superior original\\r\\ngenius. We may surely educate children to this habit of abstracting\\r\\nthe attention, which we allow depends entirely upon practice. When we\\r\\nare very much interested upon any subject, we attend to it\\r\\nexclusively, and, without any effort, we surmount all petty\\r\\ninterposing interruptions. When we are reading an interesting book,\\r\\ntwenty people may converse round about us, without our hearing one\\r\\nword that they say; when we are in a crowded playhouse, the moment we\\r\\nbecome interested in the play, the audience vanish from our sight, and\\r\\nin the midst of various noises, we hear only the voices of the actors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the same manner, children, by their eager looks and their\\r\\nunaffected absence to all external circumstances, show when they are\\r\\nthoroughly interested by any story that is told with eloquence suited\\r\\nto their age. When we would teach them to attend in the midst of noise\\r\\nand interruptions, we should begin by talking to them about things\\r\\nwhich we are sure will please them; by degrees we may speak on less\\r\\ncaptivating subjects, when we perceive that their habit of beginning\\r\\nto listen with an expectation of pleasure is formed. Whenever a child\\r\\nhappens to be intent upon any favourite amusement, or when he is\\r\\nreading any very entertaining book, we may increase the busy hum\\r\\naround him, we may make what bustle we please, he will probably\\r\\ncontinue attentive; it is useful therefore to give him such amusements\\r\\nand such books when there is a noise or bustle in the room, because\\r\\nthen he will learn to disregard all interruptions; and when this habit\\r\\nis formed, he may even read less amusing books in the same company\\r\\nwithout being interrupted by the usual noises.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe power of abstracting our attention is universally allowed to be\\r\\nnecessary to the successful labour of the understanding; but we may\\r\\nfurther observe, that this abstraction is characteristic in some cases\\r\\nof heroism as well as of genius. Charles the Twelfth and Archimedes\\r\\nwere very different men; yet both, in similar circumstances, gave\\r\\nsimilar proofs of their uncommon power of abstracting their attention.\\r\\n\"What has the bomb to do with what you are writing to Sweden,\" said\\r\\nthe hero to his pale secretary when a bomb burst through the roof of\\r\\nhis apartment, and he continued to dictate his letter. Archimedes went\\r\\non with his demonstration in the midst of a siege, and when a brutal\\r\\nsoldier entered with a drawn sword, the philosopher only begged he\\r\\nmight solve his problem before he was put to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresence of mind in danger, which is usually supposed to depend upon\\r\\nour quick perception of all the present circumstances, frequently\\r\\ndemands a total abstraction of our thoughts. In danger, fear is the\\r\\nmotive which excites our exertions; but from all the ideas that fear\\r\\nnaturally suggests, we must abstract our attention, or we shall not\\r\\nact with courage or prudence. In proportion to the violence of our\\r\\nterror, our voluntary exertion must be great to withdraw our thoughts\\r\\nfrom the present danger, and to recollect the means of escape. In some\\r\\ncases, where the danger has been associated with the use of certain\\r\\nmethods of escape, we use these without deliberation, and consequently\\r\\nwithout any effort of attention; as when we see any thing catch fire,\\r\\nwe instantly throw water upon the flames to extinguish them. But in\\r\\nnew situations, where we have no mechanical courage, we must exert\\r\\nmuch voluntary, quick, abstract attention, to escape from danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lee, the poet, was confined in Bedlam, a friend went to visit\\r\\nhim; and finding that he could converse reasonably, or at least\\r\\nreasonably for a poet, imagined that Lee was cured of his madness. The\\r\\npoet offered to show him Bedlam. They went over this melancholy,\\r\\nmedical prison, Lee moralising philosophically enough all the time to\\r\\nkeep his companion perfectly at ease. At length they ascended together\\r\\nto the top of the building; and, as they were both looking down from\\r\\nthe perilous height, Lee seized his friend by the arm, \"Let us\\r\\nimmortalize ourselves!\" he exclaimed; \"let us take this leap. We\\'ll\\r\\njump down together this instant.\" \"Any man could jump down,\" said his\\r\\nfriend, coolly; \"we should not immortalize ourselves by that leap; but\\r\\nlet us go down, and try if we can jump up again.\" The madman, struck\\r\\nwith the idea of a more astonishing leap than that which he had\\r\\nhimself proposed, yielded to this new impulse, and his friend rejoiced\\r\\nto see him run down stairs full of a new project for securing\\r\\nimmortality.\\r\\n\\r\\nLee\\'s friend, upon this occasion, showed rather absence than presence\\r\\nof mind: before he could have invented the happy answer that saved his\\r\\nlife, he must have abstracted his mind from the passion of fear; he\\r\\nmust have rapidly turned his attention upon a variety of ideas\\r\\nunconnected by any former associations with the exciting\\r\\nmotive--falling from a height--fractured skulls--certain\\r\\ndeath--impossibility of reasoning or wrestling with a madman. This was\\r\\nthe train of thoughts which we might naturally expect to arise in such\\r\\na situation, but from all these the man of presence of mind turned\\r\\naway his attention; he must have directed his thoughts in a contrary\\r\\nline: first, he must have thought of the means of saving himself, of\\r\\nsome argument likely to persuade a madman, of some argument peculiarly\\r\\nsuited to Lee\\'s imagination, and applicable to his situation; he must\\r\\nat this moment have considered that alarming situation without\\r\\nthinking of his fears; for the interval in which all these ideas\\r\\npassed in his mind, must have been so short that he could not have had\\r\\nleisure to combat fear; if any of the ideas associated with that\\r\\npassion had interrupted his reasonings, he would not have invented his\\r\\nanswer in time to have saved his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot foresee on what occasions presence of mind may be wanted,\\r\\nbut we may, by education, give that general command of abstract\\r\\nattention, which is essential to its exercise in all circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nTransition of thought, the power of turning attention quickly to\\r\\ndifferent subjects or employments, is another of those mental habits,\\r\\nwhich in some cases we call genius, and which in others we perceive\\r\\ndepends entirely upon practice. A number of trials in one newspaper,\\r\\nupon a variety of unconnected subjects, once struck our eye, and we\\r\\nsaw the name of a celebrated lawyer[28] as counsel in each cause. We\\r\\ncould not help feeling involuntary admiration at that versatility of\\r\\ngenius, which could pass from a fractional calculation about a London\\r\\nchaldron of coals, to the Jamaica laws of insurance; from the bargains\\r\\nof a citizen, to the divorce of a fine lady; from pathos to argument;\\r\\nfrom arithmetic to wit; from cross examination to eloquence. For a\\r\\nmoment we forgot our sober principles, and ascribed all this\\r\\nversatility of mind to natural genius; but upon reflection we recurred\\r\\nto the belief, that this dexterity of intellect was not bestowed by\\r\\nnature. We observe in men who have no pretensions to genius, similar\\r\\nversatility of mind as to their usual employments. The daily\\r\\noccupations of Mr. Elwes\\'s huntsman were as various and incongruous,\\r\\nand required as quick transitions of attention, as any that can well\\r\\nbe imagined.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At[29] four o\\'clock he milked the cows; then got breakfast for Mr.\\r\\nElwes and friends; then slipping on a green coat, he hurried into the\\r\\nstable, saddled the horses, got the hounds out of the kennel, and away\\r\\nthey went into the field. After the fatigues of hunting, he\\r\\n_refreshed_ himself, by rubbing down two or three horses as quickly as\\r\\nhe could; then running into the house to lay the cloth, and wait at\\r\\ndinner; then hurrying again into the stable to feed the horses,\\r\\ndiversified with an interlude of the cows again to milk, the dogs to\\r\\nfeed, and eight hunters to litter down for the night.\" Mr. Elwes used\\r\\nto call this huntsman an idle dog, who wanted to be paid for doing\\r\\nnothing!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not mean to require any such rapid daily transitions in the\\r\\nexercise of attention from our pupils; but we think that much may be\\r\\ndone to improve versatility of mind, by a judicious arrangement of\\r\\ntheir occupations. When we are tired of smelling a rose, we can smell\\r\\na carnation with pleasure; and when the sense of smell is fatigued,\\r\\nyet we can look at the beautiful colours with delight. When we are\\r\\ntired of thinking upon one subject, we can attend to another; when our\\r\\nmemory is fatigued, the exercise of the imagination entertains us; and\\r\\nwhen we are weary of reasoning, we can amuse ourselves with wit and\\r\\nhumour. Men, who have attended much to the cultivation of their mind,\\r\\nseem to have felt all this, and they have kept some subordinate taste\\r\\nas a refreshment after their labours. Descartes went from the system\\r\\nof the world to his flower-garden; Galileo used to read Ariosto; and\\r\\nthe metaphysical Dr. Clarke recovered himself from abstraction by\\r\\njumping over chairs and tables. The learned and indefatigable\\r\\nchancellor d\\'Aguesseau declared, that change of employment was the\\r\\nonly recreation he ever knew. Even Montaigne, who found his recreation\\r\\nin playing with his cat, educated himself better than those are\\r\\neducated who go from intense study to complete idleness. It has been\\r\\nvery wisely recommended by Mr. Locke, that young people should early\\r\\nbe taught some mechanical employment, or some agreeable art, to which\\r\\nthey may recur for relief when they are tired by mental\\r\\napplication.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nDoctor Darwin supposes that \"animal motions, or configurations of the\\r\\norgans of sense, constitute our ideas.[31] The fatigue, he observes,\\r\\nthat follows a continued attention of the mind to one object, is\\r\\nrelieved by changing the subject of our thoughts, as the continued\\r\\nmovement of one limb is relieved by moving another in its stead.\" Dr.\\r\\nDarwin has further suggested a tempting subject of experiment in his\\r\\ntheory of ocular spectra, to which we refer ingenious preceptors. Many\\r\\nuseful experiments in education might be tried upon the principles\\r\\nwhich are there suggested. We dare not here trust ourselves to\\r\\nspeculate upon this subject, because we are not at present provided\\r\\nwith a sufficient number of facts to apply our theory to practice. If\\r\\nwe could exactly discover how to arrange mental employments so as to\\r\\ninduce actions in the antagonist faculties of the mind, we might\\r\\nrelieve it from fatigue in the same manner as the eye is relieved by\\r\\nchange of colour. By pursuing this idea, might we not hope to\\r\\ncultivate the general power of attention to a degree of perfection\\r\\nhitherto unknown?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have endeavoured to show how, by different arrangements and proper\\r\\nexcitations, a preceptor may acquire that command over the attention\\r\\nof his pupils, which is absolutely essential to successful\\r\\ninstruction; but we must recollect, that when the years commonly\\r\\ndevoted to education are over, when young people are no longer under\\r\\nthe care of a preceptor, they will continue to feel the advantages of\\r\\na command of attention, whenever they mix in the active business of\\r\\nlife, or whenever they apply to any profession, to literature, or\\r\\nscience. Their attention must now be entirely voluntary; they will\\r\\nhave no tutor to excite them to exertion, no nice habitual\\r\\narrangements to assist them in their daily occupations. It is of\\r\\nconsequence, therefore, that we should substitute the power of\\r\\nvoluntary, for the habit of associated, attention. With young children\\r\\nwe depend upon particular associations of place, time, and manner,\\r\\nupon different sorts of excitement, to produce habits of employment:\\r\\nbut as our pupils advance in their education, all these temporary\\r\\nexcitements should be withdrawn. Some large, but distant object, some\\r\\npursuit which is not to be rewarded with immediate praise, but rather\\r\\nwith permanent advantage and esteem, should be held out to the\\r\\nambition of youth. All the arrangements should be left to the pupil\\r\\nhimself, all the difficulties should be surmounted by his own\\r\\nindustry, and the interest he takes in his own success and\\r\\nimprovement, will now probably be a sufficient stimulus; his\\r\\npreceptor will now rather be his partner than his master, he should\\r\\nrather share the labour than attempt to direct it: this species of\\r\\nsympathy in study, diminishes the pain of attention, and gives an\\r\\nagreeable interest even in the most tiresome researches. When a young\\r\\nman perceives that his preceptor becomes in this manner the companion\\r\\nof his exertions, he loses all suspicion that he is compelled to\\r\\nmental labour; it is improper to say _loses_, for in a good education\\r\\nthis suspicion need not ever be created: he discovers, we should\\r\\nrather say, that all the habits of attention which he has acquired,\\r\\nare those which are useful to men as well as to children, and he feels\\r\\nthe advantage of his cultivated powers on every fresh occasion. He\\r\\nwill perceive, that young men who have been ill educated, cannot, by\\r\\nany motive, command their vigorous attention, and he will feel the\\r\\ncause of his own superiority, when he comes to any trial of skill with\\r\\ninattentive _men of genius_.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the arguments which Bayle uses, to prove that fortune has a\\r\\ngreater influence than prudence in the affairs of men, is founded upon\\r\\nthe common observation, that men of the best abilities cannot\\r\\nfrequently recollect, in urgent circumstances, what they have said or\\r\\ndone; the things occur to them perhaps a moment after they are past.\\r\\nThe fact seems to be, that they could not, in the proper moment,\\r\\ncommand their attention; but this we should attribute to the want of\\r\\nprudence in their early education. Thus, Bayle\\'s argument does not, in\\r\\nthis point of view, prove any thing in favour of fortune. Those who\\r\\ncan best command their attention, in the greatest variety of\\r\\ncircumstances, have the most useful abilities; without this command of\\r\\nmind, men of genius, as they are called, are helpless beings; with it,\\r\\npersons of inferior capacity become valuable. Addison trembled and\\r\\ndoubted, and doubted and trembled, when he was to write a common\\r\\nofficial paper; and it is said, that he was absolutely obliged to\\r\\nresign his place, because he could not decide in time whether he\\r\\nshould write a _that_ or a _which_. No business could have been\\r\\ntransacted by such an imbecile minister.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo substitute voluntary for associated attention, we may withdraw some\\r\\nof the usually associated circumstances, and increase the excitement;\\r\\nand we may afterwards accustom the pupil to act from the hope of\\r\\ndistant pleasures. Unless children can be actuated by the view of\\r\\nfuture distant advantage, they cannot be capable of long continued\\r\\napplication. We shall endeavour to explain how the value of distant\\r\\npleasures can be increased, and made to act with sufficient force upon\\r\\nthe mind, when we hereafter speak of judgment and of imagination.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been observed, that persons of wit and judgment have perhaps\\r\\noriginally the same powers, and that the difference in their\\r\\ncharacters arises from their habits of attention, and the different\\r\\nclass of objects to which they have turned their thoughts. The manner\\r\\nin which we are first taught to observe, and to reason, must in the\\r\\nfirst years of life decide these habits. There are two methods of\\r\\nteaching; one which ascends from particular facts to general\\r\\nprinciples, the other which descends from the general principles to\\r\\nparticular facts; one which builds up, another which takes to pieces;\\r\\nthe synthetic and the analytic method. The words analysis and\\r\\nsynthesis are frequently misapplied, and it is difficult to write or\\r\\nto speak long about these methods without confounding them: in\\r\\nlearning or in teaching, we often use them alternately. We first\\r\\nobserve particulars; then form some general idea of classification;\\r\\nthen descend again to new particulars, to observe whether they\\r\\ncorrespond with our principle.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren acquire knowledge, and their attention alternates from\\r\\nparticular to general ideas, exactly in the same manner. It has been\\r\\nremarked, that men who have begun by forming suppositions, are\\r\\ninclined to adapt and to compress their consequent observations to\\r\\nthe measure of their theories; they have been negligent in collecting\\r\\nfacts, and have not condescended to try experiments. This disposition\\r\\nof mind, during a long period of time, retarded improvement, and\\r\\nknowledge was confined to a few peremptory maxims and exclusive\\r\\nprinciples. The necessity of collecting facts, and of trying\\r\\nexperiments, was at length perceived; and in all the sciences this\\r\\nmode has lately prevailed: consequently, we have now on many subjects\\r\\na treasure of accumulated facts. We are, in educating children, to put\\r\\nthem in possession of all this knowledge; and a judicious preceptor\\r\\nwill wish to know, not only how these facts can be crammed speedily\\r\\ninto his pupil\\'s memory, but what order of presenting them will be\\r\\nmost advantageous to the understanding; he will desire to cultivate\\r\\nhis pupil\\'s faculties, that he may acquire new facts, and make new\\r\\nobservations after all the old facts have been arranged in his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy a judicious arrangement of past experiments, and by the rejection\\r\\nof what are useless, an able instructer can show, in a small compass,\\r\\nwhat it has cost the labour of ages to accumulate; he may teach in a\\r\\nfew hours what the most ingenious pupil, left to his own random\\r\\nefforts, could not have learned in many years. It would take up as\\r\\nmuch time to go over all the steps which have been made in any\\r\\nscience, as it originally cost the first discoverers. Simply to repeat\\r\\nall the fruitless experiments which have been made in chemistry, for\\r\\ninstance, would probably employ the longest life that ever was devoted\\r\\nto science; nor would the individual have got one step forwarder; he\\r\\nwould die, and with him his recapitulated knowledge; neither he nor\\r\\nthe world would be the better for it. It is our business to save\\r\\nchildren all this useless labour, and all this waste of the power of\\r\\nattention. A pupil, who is properly instructed, with the same quantity\\r\\nof attention, learns, perhaps, a hundred times as much in the same\\r\\ntime, as he could acquire under the tuition of a learned preceptor\\r\\nignorant in the art of teaching.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe analytic and synthetic methods of instruction will both be found\\r\\nuseful when judiciously employed. Where the enumeration of particulars\\r\\nfatigues the attention, we should, in teaching any science, begin by\\r\\nstating the general principles, and afterwards produce only the facts\\r\\nessential to their illustration and proof. But wherever we have not\\r\\naccumulated a sufficient number of facts to be accurately certain of\\r\\nany general principle, we must, however tedious the task, enumerate\\r\\nall the facts that are known, and warn the pupil of the imperfect\\r\\nstate of the science. All the facts must, in this case, be stored up\\r\\nwith scrupulous accuracy; we cannot determine which are unimportant,\\r\\nand which may prove essentially useful: this can be decided only by\\r\\nfuture experiments. By thus stating honestly to our pupils the extent\\r\\nof our ignorance, as well as the extent of our knowledge; by thus\\r\\ndirecting attention to the imperfections of science, rather than to\\r\\nthe study of theories, we shall avoid the just reproaches which have\\r\\nbeen thrown upon the dogmatic vanity of learned preceptors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For as knowledges are now,\" says Bacon, \"there is a kind of contract\\r\\nof errour between the deliverer and receiver; for he that delivereth\\r\\nknowledge, desireth to deliver it in such a form as may be best\\r\\nbelieved, and not as may be best examined; and he that receiveth\\r\\nknowledge, desireth rather present satisfaction than expectant\\r\\ninquiry; and so rather not to doubt, than not to err; glory making the\\r\\nauthor not to lay open his weakness, and sloth making the disciple not\\r\\nto know his strength.\"[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[13] V.

The\\r\\nboy must have immediately perceived the object of his nurse\\'s\\r\\ncasuistry. He must guess that she would be blamed for the addition of\\r\\nthe sugar, else why should she wish to suppress the word? His\\r\\ngratitude is engaged to his nurse for running this risk to indulge\\r\\nhim; his mother, by the force of contrast, appears a severe person,\\r\\nwho, for no reason that he can comprehend, would deprive him of the\\r\\ninnocent pleasure of eating sugar. As to its making him sick, he has\\r\\neat it, and he is not sick; as to its spoiling his teeth, he does not\\r\\ncare about his teeth, and he sees no immediate change in them:\\r\\ntherefore he concludes that his mother\\'s orders are capricious, and\\r\\nthat his nurse loves him better because she gives him the most\\r\\npleasure. His honour and affection towards his nurse, are immediately\\r\\nset in opposition to his duty to his mother. What a hopeful beginning\\r\\nin education! What a number of dangerous ideas may be given by a\\r\\nsingle word!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe taste for sugared bread and butter is soon over; but servants\\r\\nhave it in their power to excite other tastes with premature and\\r\\nfactitious enthusiasm. The waiting-maid, a taste for dress; the\\r\\nfootman, a taste for gaming; the coachman and groom, for horses and\\r\\nequipage; and the butler, for wine. The simplicity of children is not\\r\\na defence to them; and though they are totally ignorant of vice, they\\r\\nare exposed to adopt the principles of those with whom they live, even\\r\\nbefore they can apply them to their own conduct.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young son of a lady of quality, a boy of six or seven years old,\\r\\naddressed, with great simplicity, the following speech to a lady who\\r\\nvisited his mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Boy._ Miss N----, I wish you could find somebody, when you go to\\r\\nLondon, who would keep you. It\\'s a very good thing to be kept.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Lady._ What do you mean, my dear?\\r\\n\\r\\n_Boy._ Why it\\'s when--you know, when a person\\'s kept, they have every\\r\\nthing found for them; their friend saves them all trouble, you know.\\r\\nThey have a _carriage_ and _diamonds_, and every thing they want. I\\r\\nwish somebody would keep you.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Lady_, laughing. But I\\'m afraid nobody would. Do you think any body\\r\\nwould?\\r\\n\\r\\n_Boy_, after a pause. Why yes, I think Sir ----, naming a gentleman\\r\\nwhose name had, at this time, been much talked of in a public trial,\\r\\nwould be as likely as any body.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same boy talked familiarly of ph\\xc3\\xa6tons and gigs, and wished that he\\r\\nwas grown up, that he might drive four horses in hand. It is obvious\\r\\nthat these ideas were put into the boy\\'s head by the servants with\\r\\nwhom he associated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout supposing them to be profligate, servants, from their\\r\\nsituation, from all that they see of the society of their superiors,\\r\\nand from the early prejudices of their own education, learn to admire\\r\\nthat wealth and rank to which they are bound to pay homage. The\\r\\nluxuries and follies of fashionable life they mistake for happiness;\\r\\nthey measure the respect they pay to strangers by their external\\r\\nappearance; they value their own masters and mistresses by the same\\r\\nstandard; and in their attachment there is a necessary mixture of that\\r\\nsympathy which is sacred to prosperity. Setting aside all interested\\r\\nmotives, servants love show and prodigality in their masters; they\\r\\nfeel that they partake the triumph, and they wish it to be as\\r\\nmagnificent as possible. These dispositions break out naturally in the\\r\\nconversation of servants with one another; if children are suffered to\\r\\nhear them, they will quickly catch the same tastes. But if these ideas\\r\\nbreak out in their unpremeditated gossiping with one another, how much\\r\\nmore strongly will they be expressed when servants wish to ingratiate\\r\\nthemselves into a child\\'s affections by flattery! Their method of\\r\\nshowing their attachment to a family, is usually to exaggerate in\\r\\ntheir expressions of admiration of its consequence and grandeur; they\\r\\ndepreciate all whom they imagine to be competitors in any respect with\\r\\ntheir masters, and feed and foster the little jealousies which exist\\r\\nbetween neighbouring families. The children of these families are thus\\r\\nearly set at variance; the children in the same family are often\\r\\ntaught, by the imprudence or malice of servants, to dislike and envy\\r\\neach other. In houses where each child has an attendant, the\\r\\nattendants regularly quarrel, and, out of a show of zeal, make their\\r\\nyoung masters and mistresses parties in their animosity. Three or four\\r\\nmaids sometimes produce their little dressed pupils for a few minutes\\r\\nto _the company_ in the drawing room, for the express purpose of\\r\\nseeing which shall obtain the greatest share of admiration. This\\r\\ncompetition, which begins in their nurses\\' arms, is continued by daily\\r\\nartifices through the whole course of their nursery education. Thus\\r\\nthe emulation of children is rendered a torment to them, their\\r\\nambition is directed to absurd and vile purposes, the understanding is\\r\\nperverted, their temper is spoiled, their simplicity of mind, and\\r\\ntheir capability of enjoying happiness, materially injured.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe language and manners, the awkward and vulgar tricks which\\r\\nchildren learn in the society of servants, are immediately perceived,\\r\\nand disgust and shock well-bred parents. This is an evil which is\\r\\nstriking and disgraceful; it is more likely to be remedied than those\\r\\nwhich are more secret and slow in their operation: the habits of\\r\\ncunning, falsehood, envy, which lurk in the temper, are not instantly\\r\\nvisible to strangers; they do not appear the moment children are\\r\\nreviewed by parents; they may remain for years without notice or\\r\\nwithout cure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these things have been said a hundred times; and, what is more,\\r\\nthey are universally acknowledged to be true. It has passed into a\\r\\ncommon maxim with all who reflect, and even with all who speak upon\\r\\nthe subject of education, that \"it is the worst thing in the world to\\r\\nleave children with servants.\" But, notwithstanding this, each person\\r\\nimagines that he has found some lucky exception to the general rule.\\r\\nThere is some favourite maid or phoenix of a footman in each family,\\r\\nwho is supposed to be unlike all other servants, and, therefore,\\r\\nqualified for the education of children. But, if their qualifications\\r\\nwere scrupulously examined, it is to be feared they would not be found\\r\\ncompetent to the trust that is reposed in them. They may,\\r\\nnevertheless, be excellent servants, much attached to their masters\\r\\nand mistresses, and sincerely desirous to obey their orders in the\\r\\nmanagement of their pupils; but this is not sufficient. In education\\r\\nit is not enough to obey the laws; it is necessary to understand them,\\r\\nto understand the spirit, as well as the letter of the law. The blind\\r\\napplication of general maxims will never succeed; and can that nice\\r\\ndiscrimination which is necessary to the just use of good principles,\\r\\nbe expected from those who have never studied the human mind, who have\\r\\nlittle motive for the study, whose knowledge is technical, and who\\r\\nhave never had any liberal education? Give, or attempt to give, the\\r\\nbest waiting-maid in London the general maxim, \"That pain should be\\r\\nassociated with whatever we wish to make children avoid doing; and\\r\\npleasure should be associated with whatever we wish that children\\r\\nshould love to do;\" will the waiting-maid understand this, even if you\\r\\nexchange the word _associated_ for _joined_? How will she apply her\\r\\nnew principle in practice? She will probably translate it into, \"Whip\\r\\nthe child when it is troublesome, and give it sweetmeats when it does\\r\\nas it is bid.\" With this compendious system of tuition she is well\\r\\nsatisfied, especially as it contains nothing which is new to her\\r\\nunderstanding, or foreign to her habits. But if we should expect her\\r\\nto enter into the views of a Locke or a Barbauld, would it not be at\\r\\nonce unreasonable and ridiculous?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat has been said of the understanding and dispositions of servants,\\r\\nrelates only to servants as they are now educated. Their vices and\\r\\ntheir ignorance arise from the same causes, the want of education.\\r\\nThey are not a separate cast in society, doomed to ignorance, or\\r\\ndegraded by inherent vice; they are capable, they are desirous of\\r\\ninstruction. Let them be well educated,[34] and the difference in\\r\\ntheir conduct and understanding will repay society for the trouble of\\r\\nthe undertaking. This education must begin as early as possible; let\\r\\nus not imagine that it is practicable to change the habits of servants\\r\\nwho are already educated, and to make them suddenly fit companions in\\r\\na family. They should not, in any degree, be permitted to interfere\\r\\nwith the management of children, until their own education has been\\r\\nradically reformed. Let servants be treated with the utmost kindness;\\r\\nlet their situations be made as happy as possible; let the reward of\\r\\ntheir services and attachment be as liberal as possible; but reward\\r\\nwith justice, do not sacrifice your children to pay your own debts.\\r\\nFamiliarity between servants and children, cannot permanently increase\\r\\nthe happiness of either party. Children, who have early lived with\\r\\nservants, as they grow up are notoriously apt to become capricious and\\r\\ntyrannical masters. A boy who has been used to treat a footman as his\\r\\nplay-fellow, cannot suddenly command from him that species of\\r\\ndeference, which is compounded of habitual respect for the person, and\\r\\nconventional submission to his station; the young master must,\\r\\ntherefore, effect a change in his footman\\'s manner of thinking and\\r\\nspeaking by violent means; he must extort that tribute of respect\\r\\nwhich he has neglected so long, and to which, consequently, his right\\r\\nis disputed.[35] He is sensible, that his superiority is merely that\\r\\nof situation, and he, therefore, exerts his dormant prerogatives with\\r\\njealous insolence. No master is so likely to become the tyrant of his\\r\\nvalet-de-chambre, as he who is conscious that he never _can_ appear to\\r\\nhim a hero. No servant feels the yoke of servitude more galling, than\\r\\nhe who has been partially emancipated, who has lost his habits of\\r\\n\"proud subordination, and his taste for dignified submission.\"[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nNo mistaken motive of tenderness to domestics should operate upon the\\r\\nminds of parents; nor should they hesitate, for the general happiness\\r\\nof their families, to insist upon a total separation between those\\r\\nparts of it which will injure each other essentially by their union.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery body readily disclaims the idea of letting children live with\\r\\nservants; but, besides the exceptions in favour of particular\\r\\nindividuals, there is yet another cause of the difference between\\r\\ntheory and practice upon this subject. Time is left out of the\\r\\nconsideration; people forget that life is made up of days and hours;\\r\\nand they by no means think, that letting children pass several hours\\r\\nevery day with servants, has any thing to do with the idea of living\\r\\nwith them. We must contract this latitude of expression. If children\\r\\npass one hour in a day with servants, it will be in vain to attempt\\r\\ntheir education.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame Roland, in one of her letters to De Bosc, says, that her little\\r\\ndaughter Eudora had learned to swear; \"and yet,\" continues she, \"I\\r\\nleave her but one half hour a day with servants. Admirez la\\r\\ndisposition!\" Madame Roland could not have been much accustomed to\\r\\nattend to education.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst children are very young, there appears a necessity for their\\r\\nspending at least half an hour a day with servants; until they are\\r\\nfour or five years old, they cannot dress or undress themselves, or,\\r\\nif they attempt it, they may learn careless habits, which in girls are\\r\\nparticularly to be avoided. If a mother, or a governess, would make it\\r\\na rule to be present when they are dressing, a maid-servant would not\\r\\ntalk to them, and could do them but little injury. It is of\\r\\nconsequence, that the maid-servant should herself be perfectly neat\\r\\nboth from habit and taste. Children observe exactly the manner in\\r\\nwhich every thing is done for them, and have the wish, even before\\r\\nthey have the power, to imitate what they see; they love order, if\\r\\nthey are accustomed to it, and if their first attempts at arrangement\\r\\nare not made irksome by injudicious management. What they see done\\r\\nevery day in a particular manner, they learn to think part of the\\r\\nbusiness of the day, and they are uneasy if any of the rites of\\r\\ncleanliness are forgotten; the transition from this uneasiness, to the\\r\\ndesire of exerting themselves, is soon made, particularly if they are\\r\\nsometimes left to feel the inconveniences of being helpless. This\\r\\nshould, and can, be done, without affectation. A maid cannot be always\\r\\nready, the instant she is wanted, to attend upon them; they should not\\r\\nbe waited upon as being masters and misses, they should be assisted as\\r\\nbeing helpless.[37] They will not feel their vanity flattered by this\\r\\nattendance; the maid will not be suffered to amuse them, they will be\\r\\nambitious of independence, and they will soon be proud of doing every\\r\\nthing for themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother circumstance which keeps children long in subjection to\\r\\nservants, is their not being able to wield a knife, fork, or spoon,\\r\\nwith decent dexterity. Such habits are taught to them by the careless\\r\\nmaids who feed them, that they cannot for many years be produced even\\r\\nat the side-table without much inconvenience and constant anxiety. If\\r\\nthis anxiety in a mother were to begin a little sooner, it need never\\r\\nbe intense; patient care in feeding children neatly at first, will\\r\\nsave many a bitter reprimand afterwards; their little mouths and hands\\r\\nneed not be disgusting at their meals, and their nurses had better\\r\\ntake care not to let them touch what is disagreeable, instead of\\r\\nrubbing their lips rudely with a rough napkin, by way of making them\\r\\nlove to have their mouths clean. These minuti\\xc3\\xa6 must, in spite of\\r\\ndidactic dignity, be noticed, because they lead to things of greater\\r\\nconsequence; they are well worth the attention of a prudent mother or\\r\\ngoverness. If children are early taught to eat with care, they will\\r\\nnot, from false shame, desire to dine[38] with the vulgar indulgent\\r\\nnursery-maid, rather than with the fastidious company at their\\r\\nmother\\'s table. Children should first be taught to eat with a spoon\\r\\nwhat has been neatly cut for them; afterwards they should cut a little\\r\\nmeat for themselves towards the end of dinner, when the rage of hunger\\r\\nis appeased; they will then have \"leisure to be good.\" The several\\r\\noperations of learning to eat with a spoon, to cut and to eat with a\\r\\nknife and fork, will become easy and habitual, if sufficient time be\\r\\nallowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral children in a family, who were early attended to in all these\\r\\nlittle particulars, were produced at table when they were four or five\\r\\nyears old; they suffered no constraint, nor were they ever banished to\\r\\nthe nursery lest _company_ should detect their evil habits. Their eyes\\r\\nand ears were at liberty during the time of dinner; and instead of\\r\\nbeing absorbed in the contemplation of their plates, and at war with\\r\\nthemselves and their neighbours, they could listen to conversation,\\r\\nand were amused even whilst they were eating. Without meaning to\\r\\nassert, with Rousseau, that all children are naturally gluttons or\\r\\nepicures, we must observe, that eating is their first great and\\r\\nnatural pleasure; this pleasure should, therefore, be _entirely_ at\\r\\nthe disposal of those who have the care of their education; it should\\r\\nbe associated with the idea of their tutors or governesses. A\\r\\ngoverness may, perhaps, disdain to use the same means to make herself\\r\\nbeloved by a child, as those which are employed by a nursery-maid; nor\\r\\nis it meant that children should be governed by their love of eating.\\r\\nEating need not be made a reward, nor should we restrain their\\r\\nappetite as a punishment; praise and blame, and a variety of other\\r\\nexcitements, must be preferred when we want to act upon their\\r\\nunderstanding. Upon this subject we shall speak more fully hereafter.\\r\\nAll that is here meant to be pointed out, is, that the mere physical\\r\\npleasure of eating should not be associated in the minds of children\\r\\nwith servants; it should not be at the disposal of servants, because\\r\\nthey may, in some degree, balance by this pleasure the other motives\\r\\nwhich a tutor may wish to put in action. \"Solid pudding,\" as well as\\r\\n\"empty praise,\" should be in the gift of the preceptor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the pleasures of the table, there are many others which\\r\\nusually are associated early with servants. After children have been\\r\\npent in a close formal drawing-room, motionless and mute, they are\\r\\nfrequently dismissed to an apartment where there is no furniture too\\r\\nfine to be touched with impunity, where there is ample space, where\\r\\nthey may jump and sing, and make as much noise as can be borne by the\\r\\nmuch-enduring eardrum of the nursery-maid. Children think this\\r\\ninsensibility of ear a most valuable qualification in any person; they\\r\\nhave no sympathy with more refined auditory nerves, and they prefer\\r\\nthe company of those who are to them the best hearers. A medium\\r\\nbetween their taste and that of their parents should, in this\\r\\ninstance, be struck; parents should not insist upon eternal silence,\\r\\nand children should not be suffered to make mere noise essential to\\r\\ntheir entertainment. Children should be encouraged to talk at proper\\r\\ntimes, and should have occupations provided for them when they are\\r\\nrequired to be still; by these means it will not be a restraint to\\r\\nthem to stay in the same room with the rest of the family for some\\r\\nhours in the day. At other times they should have free leave to run\\r\\nabout either in rooms where they cannot disturb others, or out of\\r\\ndoors; in neither case should they be with servants. Children should\\r\\nnever be sent out to walk with servants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter they have been poring over their lessons, or stiffening under\\r\\nthe eye of their preceptors, they are frequently consigned immediately\\r\\nto the ready footman; they cluster round him for their hats, their\\r\\ngloves, their little boots and whips, and all the well known signals\\r\\nof pleasure. The hall door bursts open, and they sally forth under the\\r\\ninterregnum of this beloved protector, to enjoy life and liberty; all\\r\\nthe natural, and all the factitious ideas of the love of liberty, are\\r\\nconnected with this distinct part of the day; the fresh air--the green\\r\\nfields--the busy streets--the gay shops--the variety of objects which\\r\\nthe children see and hear--the freedom of their tongues--the joys of\\r\\nbodily exercise, and of mental relaxation, all conspire to make them\\r\\nprefer this period of the day, which they spend with the footman, to\\r\\nany other in the four-and-twenty hours. The footman sees, and is\\r\\nflattered by this; he is therefore assiduous to please, and piques\\r\\nhimself upon being more indulgent than the hated preceptor. Servants\\r\\nusually wish to make themselves beloved by children; can it be\\r\\nwondered at if they succeed, when we consider the power that is thrown\\r\\ninto their hands?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn towns, children have no gardens, no place where they can take that\\r\\ndegree of exercise which is necessary for their health; this tempts\\r\\ntheir parents to trust them to servants, when they cannot walk with\\r\\nthem themselves: but is there no individual in the family, neither\\r\\ntutor, nor governess, nor friend, nor brother, nor sister, who can\\r\\nundertake this daily charge? Cannot parents sacrifice some of their\\r\\namusements in town, or cannot they live in the country? If none of\\r\\nthese things can be done, without hesitation they should prefer a\\r\\npublic to a private education. In these circumstances, they cannot\\r\\neducate their children at home; they had much better not attempt it,\\r\\nbut send them at once to school.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the country, arrangements may easily be made, which will preclude\\r\\nall those little dangers which fill a prudent parent\\'s mind with\\r\\nanxiety. Here children want the care of no servant to walk out with\\r\\nthem; they can have gardens, and safe places for exercise allotted to\\r\\nthem. In rainy weather they can have rooms apart from the rest of the\\r\\nfamily; they need not be cooped up in an ill-contrived house, where\\r\\nservants are perpetually in their way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttention to the arrangement of a house, is of material consequence.\\r\\nChildren\\'s rooms should not be passage rooms for servants; they\\r\\nshould, on the contrary, be so situated, that servants cannot easily\\r\\nhave access to them, and cannot, on any pretence of business, get the\\r\\nhabit of frequenting them. Some fixed employment should be provided\\r\\nfor children, which will keep them in a different part of the house at\\r\\nthose hours when servants must necessarily be in their bed-chambers.\\r\\nThere will be a great advantage in teaching children to arrange their\\r\\nown rooms, because this will prevent the necessity of servants being\\r\\nfor any length of time in their apartments; their things will not be\\r\\nmislaid; their playthings will not be swept away or broken; no little\\r\\ntemptations will arise to ask questions from servants; all necessity,\\r\\nand all opportunity of intercourse, will thus be cut off. Children\\r\\nshould never be sent with messages to servants, either on their own\\r\\nbusiness, or on other people\\'s; if they are permitted any times to\\r\\nspeak to them, they will not distinguish what times are proper, and\\r\\nwhat are improper.\\r\\n\\r\\nServants have so much the habit of talking to children, and think it\\r\\nsuch a proof of good nature to be interested about them, that it will\\r\\nbe difficult to make them submit to this total silence and separation.\\r\\nThe certainty that they shall lose their places, if they break through\\r\\nthe regulations of the family, will, however, be a strong motive,\\r\\nprovided that their places are agreeable and advantageous; and parents\\r\\nshould be absolutely strict in this particular. What is the loss of\\r\\nthe service of a good groom, or a good butler, compared with the\\r\\ndanger of spoiling a child? It may be feared that some _secret_\\r\\nintercourse should be carried on between children and servants; but\\r\\nthis will be lessened by the arrangements in the house, which we have\\r\\nmentioned; by care in a mother or governess, to know exactly where\\r\\nchildren are, and what they are doing every hour of the day; this need\\r\\nnot be a daily anxiety, for when certain hours have once been fixed\\r\\nfor certain occupations, habit is our friend, and we cannot have a\\r\\nsafer. There is this great advantage in measures of precaution and\\r\\nprevention, that they diminish all temptation, at the same time that\\r\\nthey strengthen the habits of obedience.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther circumstances will deter servants from running any hazard\\r\\nthemselves; they will not be so fond of children who do not live with\\r\\nthem; they will consider them as beings moving in a different sphere.\\r\\nChildren who are at ease with their parents, and happy in their\\r\\ncompany, will not seek inferior society; this will be attributed to\\r\\npride by servants, who will not like them for this reserve. So much\\r\\nthe better. Children who are encouraged to converse about every thing\\r\\nthat interests them, will naturally tell their mothers if any one\\r\\ntalks to them; a servant\\'s speaking to them would be an extraordinary\\r\\nevent to be recorded in the history of the day. The idea that it is\\r\\ndishonourable to tell tales, should never be put into their minds;\\r\\nthey will never be the spies of servants, nor should they keep their\\r\\nsecrets. Thus, as there is no faith expected from the children, the\\r\\nservants will not trust them; they will be certain of detection, and\\r\\nwill not transgress the laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may not be impertinent to conclude these minute precepts with\\r\\nassuring parents, that in a numerous family, where they have for above\\r\\ntwenty years been steadily observed, success has been the uniform\\r\\nresult.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[33] Verbatim from what has been really said to a boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[34] Perhaps an institution for the education of attendants upon\\r\\nchildren, would be of the highest utility.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. ---- had once an intention of educating forty children for this\\r\\npurpose; from amongst whom he proposed to select eight or ten as\\r\\nmasters for future schools upon the same plan.\\r\\n\\r\\n[35] V. The comedy of Wild Oats.\\r\\n\\r\\n[36] Burke.\\r\\n\\r\\n[37] Rousseau.\\r\\n\\r\\n[38] V. Sancho Panza.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V.\\r\\n\\r\\nACQUAINTANCE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The charming little dears!\" exclaims a civil acquaintance, the moment\\r\\nthe children are introduced. \"Won\\'t you come to me, love?\" At this\\r\\nquestion, perhaps, the bashful child backs towards its nurse, or its\\r\\nmother; but in vain. Rejected at this trying crisis by its natural\\r\\nprotectors, it is pushed forward into the middle of the circle, and\\r\\nall prospect of retreat being cut off, the victorious stranger seizes\\r\\nupon her little victim, whom she seats, without a struggle, upon her\\r\\nlap. To win the affections of her captive, the lady begins by a direct\\r\\nappeal to personal vanity: \"Who curls this pretty hair of yours, my\\r\\ndear? Won\\'t you let me look at your nice new red shoes? What shall I\\r\\ngive you for that fine colour in your cheeks? Let us see what we can\\r\\nfind in my pocket!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst the pocket bribes, the lady never fails to select the most\\r\\nuseless trinkets; the child would make a better choice; for, if there\\r\\nshould appear a pocket-book, which may be drawn up by a ribbon from\\r\\nits slip case, a screen that would unfold gradually into a green star,\\r\\na pocket-fan, or a tooth-pick case with a spring lock, the child would\\r\\nseize upon these with delight; but the moment its attention is fixed,\\r\\nit is interrupted by the officious exclamation of, \"Oh, let me do that\\r\\nfor you, love! Let me open that for you, you\\'ll break your sweet\\r\\nlittle nails. Ha! there is a looking-glass; whose pretty face is that?\\r\\nbut we don\\'t love people for being pretty, you know; (mamma says I\\r\\nmust not tell you you are pretty) but we love little girls for being\\r\\ngood, and I am sure you look as if you were never naughty. I am sure\\r\\nyou don\\'t know what it is to be naughty; will you give me one kiss?\\r\\nand will you hold out your pretty little hand for some sugar-plums?\\r\\nMamma shakes her head, but mamma will not be angry, though mamma can\\r\\nrefuse you nothing, I\\'ll answer for it. Who spoils you? Whose\\r\\nfavourite are you? Who do you love best in the world? And will you\\r\\nlove me? And will you come and live with me? Shall I carry you away\\r\\nwith me in the coach to-night? Oh! but I\\'m afraid I should eat you up,\\r\\nand then what would mamma say to us both?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo stop this torrent of nonsense, the child\\'s mother, perhaps,\\r\\nventures to interfere with, \"My dear, I\\'m afraid you\\'ll be\\r\\ntroublesome.\" But this produces only vehement assertions of the\\r\\ncontrary. \"The dear little creature can never be troublesome to any\\r\\nbody.\" Wo be to the child who implicitly believes this assertion!\\r\\nfrequent rebuffs from his _friends_ must be endured before this errour\\r\\nwill be thoroughly rectified: this will not tend to make those friends\\r\\nmore agreeable, or more beloved. That childish love, which varies from\\r\\nhour to hour, is scarcely worth consideration; it cannot be an object\\r\\nof competition to any reasonable person; but in early education\\r\\nnothing must be thought beneath our attention. A child does not retain\\r\\nmuch affection, it is true, for every casual visiter by whom he is\\r\\nflattered and caressed. The individuals are here to-day and gone\\r\\nto-morrow; variety prevents the impression from sinking into the mind,\\r\\nit may be said; but the general impression remains, though each\\r\\nparticular stroke is not seen. Young children, who are much caressed\\r\\nin company, are less intent than others upon pleasing those they live\\r\\nwith, and they are also less independent in their occupations and\\r\\npleasures. Those who govern such pupils have not sufficient power over\\r\\nthem, because they have not the means of giving pleasure; because\\r\\ntheir praise or blame is frequently counteracted by applause of\\r\\nvisiters. That unbroken course of experience, which is necessary for\\r\\nthe success of a regular plan of education, cannot be preserved. Every\\r\\nbody may have observed the effect, which the extraordinary notice of\\r\\nstrangers produces upon children. After the day is over, and the\\r\\ncompany has left the house, there is a cold blank; a melancholy\\r\\nsilence. The children then sink into themselves, and feel the\\r\\nmortifying change in their situation. They look with dislike upon\\r\\neverything around them; yawn with ennui, or fidget with fretfulness,\\r\\ntill on the first check which they meet with, their secret discontent\\r\\nbursts forth into a storm. Resistance, caprice, and peevishness, are\\r\\nnot borne with patience by a governess, though they are submitted to\\r\\nwith smiles by the complaisant visiter. In the same day, the same\\r\\nconduct produces totally different consequences. Experience, it is\\r\\nsaid, makes fools wise; but such experience as this, makes wise\\r\\nchildren fools.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy is this farce of civility, which disgusts all parties, continually\\r\\nrepeated between visiters and children? Visiters would willingly be\\r\\nexcused from the trouble of flattering and spoiling them; but such is\\r\\nthe spell of custom, that no one dares to break it, even when every\\r\\none feels that it is absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren, who are thought to be clever, are often produced to\\r\\nentertain company; they fill up the time, and relieve the circle from\\r\\nthat embarrassing silence, which proceeds from the having nothing to\\r\\nsay. Boys, who are thus brought forward at six or seven years old, and\\r\\nencouraged to say what are called _smart_ things, seldom, as they grow\\r\\nup, have really good understandings. Children, who, like the fools in\\r\\nformer times, are permitted to say every thing, now and then blurt out\\r\\nthose simple truths which politeness conceals: this entertains people,\\r\\nbut, in fact, it is a sort of _naivete_, which may exist without any\\r\\ngreat talent for observation, and without any powers of reasoning.\\r\\nEvery thing in our manners, in the customs of the world, is new to\\r\\nchildren, and the relations of apparently dissimilar things, strike\\r\\nthem immediately from their novelty. Children are often witty, without\\r\\nknowing it, or rather without intending it; but as they grow older,\\r\\nthe same kind of wit does not please; the same objects do not appear\\r\\nin the same point of view; and boys, who have been the delight of a\\r\\nwhole house at seven or eight years old, for the smart things they\\r\\ncould say, sink into stupidity and despondency at thirteen or\\r\\nfourteen. \"Un nom trop fameaux, est un fardeau tres pesant,\" said a\\r\\ncelebrated wit.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlain, sober sense, does not entertain common visiters, and children\\r\\nwhose minds are occupied, and who are not ambitious of exhibiting\\r\\nthemselves for the entertainment of the company, will not in general\\r\\nplease. So much the better; they will escape many dangers; not only\\r\\nthe dangers of flattery, but also the dangers of nonsense. Few people\\r\\nknow how to converse with children; they talk to them of things that\\r\\nare above, or below, their understandings; if they argue with them,\\r\\nthey do not reason fairly; they silence them with sentiment, or with\\r\\nauthority; or else they baffle them by wit, or by unintelligible\\r\\nterms. They often attempt to try their capacities with quibbles and\\r\\nsilly puzzles. Children, who are expert at answering these, have\\r\\nrarely been well educated: the extreme simplicity of sensible\\r\\nchildren, will surprise those who have not been accustomed to it, and\\r\\nmany will be provoked by their inaptitude to understand the\\r\\ncommon-place wit of conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How many sticks go to a rook\\'s nest?\" said a gentleman to a boy of\\r\\nseven years old; he looked very grave, and having pondered upon the\\r\\nquestion for some minutes, answered, \"I do not know what you mean by\\r\\nthe word go.\" Fortunately for the boy, the gentleman who asked the\\r\\nquestion, was not a captious querist; he perceived the good sense of\\r\\nthis answer; he perceived that the boy had exactly hit upon the\\r\\nambiguous word which was puzzling to the understanding, and he saw\\r\\nthat this showed more capacity than could have been shown by the\\r\\nparrying of a thousand witticisms. We have seen S----, a remarkably\\r\\nintelligent boy of nine years old, stand with the most puzzled face\\r\\nimaginable, considering for a long half hour the common quibble of\\r\\n\"There was a carpenter who made a door; he made it too large; he cut\\r\\nit and cut it, and he cut it _too little_; he cut it again, and it\\r\\nfitted.\" S---- showed very little satisfaction, when he at length\\r\\ndiscovered the double meaning of the words \"too little;\" but simply\\r\\nsaid, \"I did not know you meant that the carpenter cut _too little\\r\\noff_ the door.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which has most legs, a horse or no horse?\" \"A horse has more legs\\r\\nthan no horse,\" replies the unwary child. \"But,\" continues the witty\\r\\nsophist, \"a horse, surely, has but four legs; did you ever see a horse\\r\\nwith five legs?\" \"Never,\" says the child; \"no horse has five legs.\"\\r\\n\"Oh, ho!\" exclaims the entrapper, \"I have you now! No horse has five\\r\\nlegs, you say; then you must acknowledge that _no_ horse has more legs\\r\\nthan _a_ horse. Therefore, when I asked you which has most legs, _a\\r\\nhorse_ or _no horse_, your answer, you see, should have been, _no\\r\\nhorse_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe famous dilemma of \"you have what you have not lost; you have not\\r\\nlost horns; then you have horns;\" is much in the same style of\\r\\nreasoning. Children may readily be taught to chop logic, and to parry\\r\\ntheir adversaries technically in this contest of false wit; but this\\r\\nwill not improve their understandings, though it may, to superficial\\r\\njudges, give them the appearance of great quickness of intellect. We\\r\\nshould not, _even_ in jest, talk of nonsense to children, or suffer\\r\\nthem _even_ to hear inaccurate language. If confused answers be given\\r\\nto their questions, they will soon be content with a confused notion\\r\\nof things; they will be satisfied with bad reasoning, if they are not\\r\\ntaught to distinguish it scrupulously from what is good, and to reject\\r\\nit steadily. Half the expressions current in conversation, have merely\\r\\na nominal value; they represent no ideas, and they pass merely by\\r\\ncommon courtesy: but the language of every person of sense has\\r\\nsterling value; it cheats and puzzles nobody; and even when it is\\r\\naddressed to children, it is made intelligible. No common\\r\\nacquaintance, who talks to a child merely for its own amusement,\\r\\nselects his expressions with any care; what becomes of the child\\r\\nafterwards, is no part of his concern; he does not consider the\\r\\nadvantage of clear explanations to the understanding, nor would he be\\r\\nat the pains of explaining any thing thoroughly, even if he were able\\r\\nto do so. And how few people are able to explain distinctly, even when\\r\\nthey most wish to make themselves understood!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following conversation passed between a learned doctor (formerly)\\r\\nof the Sorbonne, and a boy of seven years old.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Doctor._ So, Sir, I see you are very advanced already in your\\r\\nstudies. You are quite expert at Latin. Pray, Sir, allow me to ask\\r\\nyou; I suppose you have heard of Tully\\'s Offices?\\r\\n\\r\\n_Boy._ Tully\\'s Offices! No, Sir.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Doctor._ No matter. You can, I will venture to say, solve me the\\r\\nfollowing question. It is not very difficult, but it has puzzled some\\r\\nabler casuists, I can tell you, though, than you or I; but if you will\\r\\nlend me your attention for a few moments, I flatter myself I shall\\r\\nmake myself intelligible to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy began to stiffen at this exordium, but he fixed himself in an\\r\\nattitude of anxious attention, and the doctor, after having taken two\\r\\npinches of snuff, proceeded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the Island of Rhodes, there was once, formerly, a great scarcity\\r\\nof provisions, a famine quite; and some merchants fitted out ten ships\\r\\nto relieve the Rhodians; and one of the merchants got into port sooner\\r\\nthan the others; and he took advantage of this circumstance to sell\\r\\nhis goods at an exorbitant rate, finding himself in possession of the\\r\\nmarket. The Rhodians did not know that the other ships laden with\\r\\nprovisions were to be in the next day; and they, of course, paid this\\r\\nmerchant whatsoever price he thought proper to demand. Now the\\r\\nquestion is, in morality, whether did he act the part of an honest man\\r\\nin this business by the Rhodians? Or should he not rather have\\r\\ninformed them of the nine ships which were expected to come with\\r\\nprovisions to the market the ensuing day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy was silent, and did not appear to comprehend the story or the\\r\\nquestion in the least. In telling his story, the doctor of the\\r\\nSorbonne unluckily pronounced the words _ship_ and _ships_ in such a\\r\\nmanner, that the child all along mistook them for _sheep_ and\\r\\n_sheeps_; and this mistake threw every thing into confusion. Besides\\r\\nthis, a number of terms were made use of which were quite new to the\\r\\nboy. Getting into port--being in possession of the market--selling\\r\\ngoods at an exorbitant rate; together with the whole mystery of buying\\r\\nand selling, were as new to him, and appeared to him as difficult to\\r\\nbe understood, as the most abstract metaphysics. He did not even know\\r\\nwhat was meant by the ships being expected _in_ the next day; and\\r\\n\"_acting the part_ of an honest man,\" was to him an unusual mode of\\r\\nexpression. The young casuist made no hand of this case of conscience;\\r\\nwhen at last he attempted an answer, he only exposed himself to the\\r\\ncontempt of the learned doctor. When he was desired to repeat the\\r\\nstory, he made a strange jumble about some people who wanted to get\\r\\nsome _sheep_, and about one man who got in his sheep before the other\\r\\nnine sheep; but he did not know how or why it was wrong in him not to\\r\\ntell of the other sheep. Nor could he imagine why the _Rhodians_ could\\r\\nnot get sheep without this man. He had never had any idea of a famine.\\r\\nThis boy\\'s father, unwilling that he should retire to rest with his\\r\\nintellects in this state of confusion, as soon as the doctor had taken\\r\\nleave, told the story to the child in different words, to try whether\\r\\nit was the words or the ideas that puzzled him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the \\xc3\\x86gean sea, which you saw the other day in the map, there is an\\r\\nIsland, which is called the Island of Rhodes. In telling my story, I\\r\\ntake the opportunity to fix a point in geography in your memory. In\\r\\nthe \\xc3\\x86gean sea there is an Island which is called the Island of Rhodes.\\r\\nThere was once a famine in this Island, that is to say, the people had\\r\\nnot food enough to live upon, and they were afraid that they should be\\r\\nstarved to death. Now, some merchants, who lived on the continent of\\r\\nGreece, filled ten ships with provisions, and they sailed in these\\r\\nvessels for the Island of Rhodes. It happened that one of these ships\\r\\ngot to the Island sooner than any of the others. It was evening, and\\r\\nthe captain of this ship knew that the others could not arrive until\\r\\nthe morning. Now the people of Rhodes, being extremely hungry, were\\r\\nvery eager to buy the provisions which this merchant had brought to\\r\\nsell; and they were ready to give a great deal more money for\\r\\nprovisions than they would have done if they had not been almost\\r\\nstarved. There was not half a sufficient quantity of food in this one\\r\\nship, to supply all the people who wanted food; and therefore those\\r\\nwho had money, and who knew that the merchant wanted as much money as\\r\\nhe could get in exchange for his provisions, offered to give him a\\r\\nlarge price, the price which he asked for them. Had these people\\r\\nknown that nine other ships full of provisions would arrive in the\\r\\nmorning, they would not have been ready to give so much money for\\r\\nfood, because they would not have been so much afraid of being\\r\\nstarved; and they would have known, that, in exchange for their money,\\r\\nthey could have a greater quantity of food the next day. The merchant,\\r\\nhowever, did not tell them that any ships were expected to arrive, and\\r\\nhe consequently got a great deal more of their money for his\\r\\nprovisions, than he would have done, if he had told them the fact\\r\\nwhich he knew, and which they did not know. Do you think that he did\\r\\nright or wrong?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child, who now had rather more the expression of intelligence in\\r\\nhis countenance, than he had when the same question had been put to\\r\\nhim after the former statement of the case, immediately answered, that\\r\\nhe \"thought the merchant had done wrong, that he should have told the\\r\\npeople that more ships were to come in the morning.\" Several different\\r\\nopinions were given afterwards by other children, and grown people who\\r\\nwere asked the same question; and what had been an unintelligible\\r\\nstory, was rendered, by a little more skill and patience in the art of\\r\\nexplanation, an excellent lesson, or rather exercise in reasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is scarcely possible that a stranger, who sees a child only for a\\r\\nfew hours, can guess what he knows, and what he does not know; or that\\r\\nhe can perceive the course of his thoughts, which depends upon\\r\\nassociations over which he has no command; therefore, when a stranger,\\r\\nlet his learning and abilities be what they will, attempts to teach\\r\\nchildren, he usually puzzles them, and the consequences of the\\r\\nconfusion of mind he creates, last sometimes for years: sometimes it\\r\\ninfluences their moral, sometimes their scientific reasoning. \"Every\\r\\nbody but my friends,\" said a little girl of six years old, \"tells me I\\r\\nam very pretty.\" From this contradictory evidence, what must the child\\r\\nhave inferred? The perplexity which some young people, almost arrived\\r\\nat the years of discretion, have shown in their first notions of\\r\\nmathematics, has been a matter of astonishment to those who have\\r\\nattempted to teach them: this perplexity has been at length discovered\\r\\nto arise from their having early confounded in their minds the ideas\\r\\nof a triangle, and an angle. In the most common modes of expression\\r\\nthere are often strange inaccuracies, which do not strike us, because\\r\\nthey are familiar to us; but children, who hear them for the first\\r\\ntime, detect their absurdity, and are frequently anxious to have such\\r\\nphrases explained. If they converse much with idle visiters, they will\\r\\nseldom be properly applauded for their precision, and their\\r\\nphilosophic curiosity will often be repressed by unmeaning replies.\\r\\nChildren, who have the habit of applying to their parents, or to\\r\\nsensible preceptors, in similar difficulties, will be somewhat better\\r\\nreceived, and will gain rather more accurate information. S---- (nine\\r\\nyears old) was in a house where a chimney was on fire; he saw a great\\r\\nbustle, and he heard the servants and people, as they ran backwards\\r\\nand forwards, all exclaim, that \"the chimney was on fire.\" After the\\r\\nfire was put out, and when the bustle was over, S---- said to his\\r\\nfather, \"What do people mean when they say the _chimney is on fire_?\\r\\nWhat is it that burns?\" At this question a silly acquaintance would\\r\\nprobably have laughed in the boy\\'s face; would have expressed\\r\\nastonishment as soon as his visit was over, at such an instance of\\r\\nstrange ignorance in a boy of nine years old; or, if civility had\\r\\nprompted any answer, it would perhaps have been, \"The chimney\\'s being\\r\\non fire, my love, means that the chimney\\'s on fire! Every body knows\\r\\nwhat\\'s meant by \\'the chimney\\'s on fire!\\' There\\'s a great deal of\\r\\nsmoke, and sparks, and flame, coming out at the top, you know, when\\r\\nthe chimney\\'s on fire. And it\\'s extremely dangerous, and would set a\\r\\nhouse on fire, or perhaps the whole neighbourhood, if it was not put\\r\\nout immediately. Many dreadful fires, you know, happen in towns, as we\\r\\nhear for ever in the newspaper, by the chimney\\'s taking fire. Did you\\r\\nnever hear of a chimney\\'s being on fire before? You are a very happy\\r\\nyoung gentleman to have lived to your time of life, and to be still at\\r\\na loss about such a thing. What burns? Why, my dear Sir, the chimney\\r\\nburns; fire burns in the chimney. To be sure fires are sad accidents;\\r\\nmany lives are lost by them every day. I had a chimney on fire in my\\r\\ndrawing room last year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus would the child\\'s curiosity have been baffled by a number of\\r\\nwords without meaning or connection; on the contrary, when he applied\\r\\nto a father, who was interested in his improvement, his sensible\\r\\nquestion was listened to with approbation. He was told, that the\\r\\nchimney\\'s being on fire, was an inaccurate common expression; that it\\r\\nwas the soot in the chimney, not the chimney, that burned; that the\\r\\nsoot was sometimes set on fire by sparks of fire, sometimes by flame,\\r\\nwhich might have been accidentally _drawn up_ the chimney. Some of the\\r\\nsoot which had been set on fire, was shown to him; the nature of\\r\\nburning in general, the manner in which the chimney _draws_, the\\r\\nmeaning of that expression, and many other things connected with the\\r\\nsubject, were explained upon this occasion to the inquisitive boy, who\\r\\nwas thus encouraged to think and speak accurately, and to apply, in\\r\\nsimilar difficulties, to the friend who had thus taken the trouble to\\r\\nunderstand his simple question. A random answer to a child\\'s question,\\r\\ndoes him a real injury; but can we expect, that those who have no\\r\\ninterest in education, should have the patience to correct their whole\\r\\nconversation, and to adapt it precisely to the capacity of children?\\r\\nThis would indeed be unreasonable; all we can do, is to keep our\\r\\npupils out of the way of those who _can_ do them no good, and who\\r\\n_may_ do them a great deal of harm. We must prefer the permanent\\r\\nadvantage of our pupils, to the transient vanity of exhibiting for the\\r\\namusement of company, their early wit, or \"lively nonsense.\" Children\\r\\nshould never be introduced for the amusement of the circle; nor yet\\r\\nshould they be condemned to sit stock still, holding up their heads\\r\\nand letting their feet dangle from chairs that are too high for them,\\r\\nmerely that they may appear what is called _well_ before visiters.\\r\\nWhenever any conversation is going forward which they can understand,\\r\\nthey should be kindly summoned to partake of the pleasures of society;\\r\\nits pains and its follies we may spare them. The manners of young\\r\\npeople will not be injured by this arrangement; they will be at ease\\r\\nin company, because whenever they are introduced into it, they will\\r\\nmake a part of it; they will be interested and happy; they will feel a\\r\\nproper confidence in themselves, and they will not be intent upon\\r\\ntheir courtesies, their frocks, their manner of holding their hands,\\r\\nor turning out their toes, the proper placing of Sir, Madam, or your\\r\\nLadyship, with all the other innumerable trifles which embarrass the\\r\\nimagination, and consequently the manners, of those who are taught to\\r\\nthink that they are to sit still, and behave in company some way\\r\\ndifferently from what they behave every day in their own family.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have hitherto only spoken of acquaintance who do not attempt or\\r\\ndesire to interfere in education, but who only caress and talk\\r\\nnonsense to children with the best intentions possible: with these,\\r\\nparents will find it comparatively easy to manage; they can contrive\\r\\nto employ children, or send them out to walk; by cool reserve, they\\r\\ncan readily discourage such visiters from flattering their children;\\r\\nand by insisting upon becoming a party in all conversations which are\\r\\naddressed to their pupils, they can, in a great measure, prevent the\\r\\nbad effects of inaccurate or imprudent conversation; they can explain\\r\\nto their pupils what was left unintelligible, and they can counteract\\r\\nfalse associations, either at the moment they perceive them, or at\\r\\nsome well-chosen opportunity. But there is a class of acquaintance\\r\\nwith whom it will be more difficult to manage; persons who are,\\r\\nperhaps, on an intimate footing with the family, who are valued for\\r\\ntheir agreeable talents and estimable qualities; who are, perhaps,\\r\\npersons of general information and good sense, and who may yet never\\r\\nhave considered the subject of education; or who, having partially\\r\\nconsidered it, have formed some peculiar and erroneous opinions. They\\r\\nwill feel themselves entitled to talk upon education as well as upon\\r\\nany other topic; they will hazard, and they will support, opinions;\\r\\nthey will be eager to prove the truth of their assertions, or the\\r\\nsuperiority of their favourite theories. Out of pure regard for their\\r\\nfriends, they will endeavour to bring them over to their own way of\\r\\nthinking in education; and they will by looks, by hints, by inuendoes,\\r\\nunrestrained by the presence of the children, insinuate their advice\\r\\nand their judgment upon every domestic occurrence. In the heat of\\r\\ndebate, people frequently forget that children have eyes and ears, or\\r\\nany portion of understanding; they are not aware of the quickness of\\r\\nthat comprehension which is excited by the motives of curiosity and\\r\\nself love. It is dangerous to let children be present at any\\r\\narguments, in which the management of their minds is concerned, until\\r\\nthey can perfectly understand the whole of the subject: they will, if\\r\\nthey catch but a few words, or a few ideas, imagine, perhaps, that\\r\\nthere is something wrong, some hardships, some injustice, practised\\r\\nagainst them by their friends; yet they will not distinctly know, nor\\r\\nwill they, perhaps, explicitly inquire what it is. They should be sent\\r\\nout of the room before any such arguments are begun; or, if the\\r\\nconversation be abruptly begun before parents can be upon their guard,\\r\\nthey may yet, without offending against the common forms of\\r\\npoliteness, decline entering into any discussion until their children\\r\\nare withdrawn. As to any direct attempt practically to interfere with\\r\\nthe children\\'s education, by blame or praise, by presents, by books,\\r\\nor by conversation; these should, and really must, be resolutely and\\r\\nsteadily resisted by parents: this will require some strength of mind.\\r\\nWhat can be done without it? Many people, who are convinced of the\\r\\ndanger of the interference of friends and acquaintance in the\\r\\neducation of their children, will yet, from the fear of offending,\\r\\nfrom the dread of being thought singular, submit to the evil. These\\r\\npersons may be very well received, and very well liked in the world:\\r\\nthey must content themselves with this reward; they must not expect to\\r\\nsucceed in education, for strength of mind is absolutely necessary to\\r\\nthose who would carry a plan of education into effect. Without being\\r\\ntied down to any one exclusive plan, and with universal toleration for\\r\\ndifferent modes of moral and intellectual instruction, it may be\\r\\nsafely asserted, that the plan which is most steadily pursued, will\\r\\nprobably succeed the best. People who are moved by the advice of all\\r\\ntheir friends, and who endeavour to adapt their system to every\\r\\nfashionable change in opinion, will inevitably repent of their weak\\r\\ncomplaisance; they will lose all power over their pupils, and will be\\r\\nforced to abandon the education of their families to chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be found impossible to educate a child at home, unless all\\r\\ninterference from visiters and acquaintance is precluded. But it is of\\r\\nyet more consequence, that the members of the family must entirely\\r\\nagree in their sentiments, or at least in the conduct of the children\\r\\nunder their care. Without this there is no hope. Young people perceive\\r\\nvery quickly, whether there is unanimity in their government; they\\r\\nmake out an alphabet of looks with unerring precision, and decipher\\r\\nwith amazing ingenuity, all that is for their interest to understand.\\r\\nWhen children are blamed or punished, they always know pretty well who\\r\\npities them, who thinks that they are in the wrong, and who thinks\\r\\nthat they are in the right; and thus the influence of public opinion\\r\\nis what ultimately governs. If children find that, when mamma is\\r\\ndispleased, grandmamma comforts them, they will console themselves\\r\\nreadily under this partial disgrace, and they will suspect others of\\r\\ncaprice, instead of ever blaming themselves. They will feel little\\r\\nconfidence in their own experience, or in the assertions of others;\\r\\nthey will think that there is always some chance of escape amongst the\\r\\nmultitude of laws and law-givers. No tutor or preceptor can be\\r\\nanswerable, or ought _to undertake to answer for measures which he\\r\\ndoes not guide_. Le Sage, with an inimitable mixture of humour and\\r\\ngood sense, in the short history of the education of the robbers who\\r\\nsupped in that cave in which dame Leonardo officiated, has given many\\r\\nexcellent lessons in education. Captain Rolando\\'s tutors could never\\r\\nmake any thing of him, because, whenever they reprimanded him, he ran\\r\\nto his mother, father, and grandfather, for consolation; and from them\\r\\nconstantly received protection in rebellion, and commiseration for the\\r\\nwounds which he had inflicted upon his own hands and face, purposely\\r\\nto excite compassion, and to obtain revenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is obviously impossible, that all the world, the ignorant and the\\r\\nwell-informed, the man of genius, the man of fashion, and the man of\\r\\nbusiness, the pedant and the philosopher, should agree in their\\r\\nopinion upon any speculative subject; upon the wide subject of\\r\\neducation they will probably differ eternally. It will, therefore, be\\r\\nthought absurd to require this union of opinion amongst the\\r\\nindividuals of a family; but, let there be ever so much difference in\\r\\ntheir private opinions, they can surely discuss any disputed point at\\r\\nleisure, when children are absent, or they can, in these arguments,\\r\\nconverse in French, or in some language which their pupils do not\\r\\nunderstand. The same caution should be observed, as we just now\\r\\nrecommended, with respect to acquaintance. It is much better, when any\\r\\ndifficulties occur, to send the children at once into any other room,\\r\\nand to tell them that we do so because we have something to say that\\r\\nwe do not wish them to hear, than to make false excuses to get rid of\\r\\ntheir company, or to begin whispering and disputing in their presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese precautions are advisable whilst our pupils are young, before\\r\\nthey are capable of comprehending arguments of this nature, and whilst\\r\\ntheir passions are vehemently interested on one side or the other. As\\r\\nyoung people grow up, the greater variety of opinions they hear upon\\r\\nall subjects, the better; they will then form the habit of judging for\\r\\nthemselves: whilst they are very young, they have not the means of\\r\\nforming correct judgments upon abstract subjects, nor are these the\\r\\nsubjects upon which their judgment can be properly exercised: upon the\\r\\nsubject of education, they cannot be competent judges, because they\\r\\ncannot, till they are nearly educated, have a complete view of the\\r\\nmeans, or of the end; besides this, no _man_ is allowed to be judge in\\r\\nhis own case.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome parents allow their children a vast deal of liberty whilst they\\r\\nare young, and restrain them by absolute authority when their reason\\r\\nis, or ought to be, a sufficient guide for their conduct. The contrary\\r\\npractice will make parents much more beloved, and will make children\\r\\nboth wiser and happier. Let no idle visiter, no intrusive, injudicious\\r\\nfriend, for one moment interfere to lessen the authority necessary for\\r\\nthe purposes of education. Let no weak jealousy, no unseasonable love\\r\\nof command, restrain young people after they are sufficiently\\r\\nreasonable to judge for themselves. In the choice of their friends,\\r\\ntheir acquaintance, in all the great and small affairs of life, let\\r\\nthem have liberty in proportion as they acquire reason. Fathers do not\\r\\ncommonly interfere with their sons\\' amusements, nor with the choice of\\r\\ntheir acquaintance, so much as in the regulation of their pecuniary\\r\\naffairs: but mothers, who have had any considerable share in the\\r\\neducation of boys, are apt to make mistakes as to the proper seasons\\r\\nfor indulgence and control. They do not watch the moments when\\r\\ndangerous prejudices and tastes begin to be formed; they do not\\r\\nperceive how the slight conversations of acquaintance operate upon the\\r\\never-open ear of childhood; but when the age of passion approaches,\\r\\nand approaches, as it usually does, in storms and tempest, then all\\r\\ntheir maternal fears are suddenly roused, and their anxiety prompts\\r\\nthem to use a thousand injudicious and ineffectual expedients.\\r\\n\\r\\nA modern princess, who had taken considerable pains in the education\\r\\nof her son, made both herself and him ridiculous by her anxiety upon\\r\\nhis introduction into the world. She travelled about with him from\\r\\nplace to place, to _make him see_ every thing worth seeing; but he was\\r\\nnot to stir from her presence; she could not bear to have him out of\\r\\nsight or hearing. In all companies he was _chaperoned_ by his mother.\\r\\nWas he invited to a ball, she must be invited also, or he could not\\r\\naccept of the invitation: he must go in the same coach, and return in\\r\\nthe same coach with her. \"I should like extremely to dance another\\r\\ndance,\" said he one evening to his partner, \"but you see I must go; my\\r\\nmother is putting on her cloak.\" The tall young man called for some\\r\\nnegus, and had the glass at his lips, when his mamma called out in a\\r\\nshrill voice, through a vista of heads, \"Eh! My son no drink wine! My\\r\\nson like milk and water!\" The son was at this time at years of\\r\\ndiscretion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI.\\r\\n\\r\\nON TEMPER.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have already, in speaking of the early care of infants, suggested\\r\\nthat the temper should be attended to from the moment of their birth.\\r\\nA negligent, a careless, a passionate servant, must necessarily injure\\r\\nthe temper of a child. The first language of an infant is\\r\\nintelligible only to its nurse; she can distinguish between the cry of\\r\\npain and the note of ill humour, or the roar of passion. The cry of\\r\\npain should be listened to with the utmost care, and every possible\\r\\nmeans should be used to relieve the child\\'s sufferings; but when it is\\r\\nobvious that he cries from ill humour, a nurse should not sooth him\\r\\nwith looks of affection, these she should reserve for the moment when\\r\\nthe storm is over. We do not mean that infants should be suffered to\\r\\ncry for a length of time without being regarded; this would give them\\r\\nhabits of ill humour: we only wish that the nurse would, as soon as\\r\\npossible, teach the child that what he wants can be obtained without\\r\\nhis putting himself in a passion. Great care should be taken to\\r\\nprevent occasions for ill humour; if a nurse neglects her charge, or\\r\\nif she be herself passionate, the child will suffer so much pain, and\\r\\nso many disappointments, that it must be in a continual state of\\r\\nfretfulness. An active, cheerful, good humoured, intelligent nurse,\\r\\nwill make a child good humoured by a regular, affectionate attendance;\\r\\nby endeavouring to prevent all unnecessary sufferings, and by quickly\\r\\ncomprehending its language of signs. The best humoured woman in the\\r\\nworld, if she is stupid, is not fit to have the care of a child; the\\r\\nchild will not be able to make her understand any thing less than\\r\\nvociferation. By way of amusing the infant, she will fatigue it with\\r\\nher caresses; without ever discovering the real cause of his wo, she\\r\\nwill sing one universal lullaby upon all occasions to pacify her\\r\\ncharge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt requires some ingenuity to discover the cause and cure of those\\r\\nlong and loud fits of crying, which frequently arise from imaginary\\r\\napprehensions. A little boy of two years old, used to cry violently\\r\\nwhen he awoke in the middle of the night, and saw a candle in the\\r\\nroom. It was observed that the shadow of the person who was moving\\r\\nabout in the room frightened him, and as soon as the cause of his\\r\\ncrying was found out, it was easy to pacify him; his fear of shadows\\r\\nwas effectually cured, by playfully showing him, at different times,\\r\\nthat shadows had no power to hurt him.\\r\\n\\r\\nH----, about nine months old, when she first began to observe the\\r\\nhardness of bodies, let her hand fall upon a cat which had crept\\r\\nunperceived upon the table; she was surprised and terrified by the\\r\\nunexpected sensation of softness; she could not touch the cat, or any\\r\\nthing that felt like soft fur, without showing agitation, till she was\\r\\nnear four years old, though every gentle means were used to conquer\\r\\nher antipathy; the antipathy was, however, cured at last, by her\\r\\nhaving a wooden cat covered with fur for a plaything.\\r\\n\\r\\nA boy, between four and five years old, H----, used to cry bitterly\\r\\nwhen he was left alone in a room, in which there were some old family\\r\\npictures. It was found that he was much afraid of these pictures: a\\r\\nmaid, who took care of him, had terrified him with the notion that\\r\\nthey would come to him, or that they were looking at him, and would be\\r\\nangry with him if he was not _good_. To cure the child of this fear of\\r\\npictures, a small sized portrait, which was not amongst the number of\\r\\nthose that had frightened him, was produced in broad day light. A\\r\\npiece of cake was put upon this picture, which the boy was desired to\\r\\ntake; he took it, touched the picture, and was shown the canvas at the\\r\\nback of it, which, as it happened to be torn, he could easily identify\\r\\nwith the painting: the picture was then given to him for a plaything;\\r\\nhe made use of it as a table, and became very fond of it as soon as he\\r\\nwas convinced that it was not alive, and that it could do him no sort\\r\\nof injury.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy patiently endeavouring to discover the causes of terror in\\r\\nchildren, we may probably prevent their tempers from acquiring many\\r\\nbad habits. It is scarcely possible for any one, who has not\\r\\nconstantly lived with a child, and who has not known the whole rise\\r\\nand progress of his little character, to trace the causes of these\\r\\nstrange apprehensions; for this reason, a parent has advantages in\\r\\nthe education of his child, which no tutor or schoolmaster can have.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little boy was observed to show signs of fear and dislike at hearing\\r\\nthe sound of a drum: to a stranger, such fear must have seemed\\r\\nunaccountable, but those who lived with the child, knew from what it\\r\\narose. He had been terrified by the sight of a merry-andrew in a mask,\\r\\nwho had played upon a drum; this was the first time that he had ever\\r\\nheard the sound of a drum; the sound was associated with fear, and\\r\\ncontinued to raise apprehensions in the child\\'s mind after he had\\r\\nforgotten the original cause of that apprehension.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are well aware that we have laid ourselves open to ridicule, by the\\r\\napparently trifling anecdotes which have just been mentioned; but if\\r\\nwe can save one child from an hour\\'s unnecessary misery, or one parent\\r\\nfrom an hour\\'s anxiety, we shall bear the laugh, we hope, with good\\r\\nhumour.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung children, who have not a great number of ideas, perhaps for that\\r\\nreason associate those which they acquire with tenacity; they cannot\\r\\nreason concerning general causes; they expect that any event, which\\r\\nhas once or twice followed another, will always follow in the same\\r\\norder; they do not distinguish between proximate and remote causes,\\r\\nbetween coincidences and the regular connection of cause and effect:\\r\\nhence children are subject to feel hopes and fears from things which\\r\\nto us appear matters of indifference. Suppose, for instance, that a\\r\\nchild is very eager to go out to walk, that his mother puts on her\\r\\ngloves and her cloak; these being the usual signals that she is going\\r\\nout, he instantly expects, if he has been accustomed to accompany her,\\r\\nthat he shall have the pleasure of walking out; but if she goes out,\\r\\nand forgets him, he is not only disappointed at that moment, but the\\r\\ndisappointment, or, at least, some indistinct apprehension, recurs to\\r\\nhim when he is in a similar situation: the putting on of his mother\\'s\\r\\ncloak and gloves, are then circumstances of vast importance to him,\\r\\nand create anxiety, perhaps tears, whilst to every other spectator\\r\\nthey are matters of total indifference. Every one, who has had any\\r\\nexperience in the education of such children as are apt to form strong\\r\\nassociations, must be aware, that many of those fits of crying, which\\r\\nappear to arise solely from ill-humour, are occasioned by association.\\r\\nWhen these are suffered to become habitual, they are extremely\\r\\ndifficult to conquer; it is, therefore, best to conquer them as soon\\r\\nas possible. If a child has, by any accident, been disposed to cry at\\r\\nparticular times in the day, without any obvious cause, we should at\\r\\nthose hours engage his attention, occupy him, change the room he is\\r\\nin, or by any new circumstance break his habits. It will require some\\r\\npenetration to distinguish between involuntary tears, and tears of\\r\\ncaprice; but even when children are really cross, it is not, whilst\\r\\nthey are very young, prudent to let them wear out their ill-humour, as\\r\\nsome people do, in total neglect. Children, when they are left to weep\\r\\nin solitude, often continue in wo for a considerable length of time,\\r\\nuntil they quite forget the original cause of complaint, and they\\r\\ncontinue their convulsive sobs, and whining note of distress, purely\\r\\nfrom inability to stop themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus habits of ill-humour are contracted; it is better, by a little\\r\\nwell-timed excitation, to turn the course of a child\\'s thoughts, and\\r\\nto make him forget his trivial miseries. \"The tear forgot as soon as\\r\\nshed,\" is far better than the peevish whine, or sullen lowering brow,\\r\\nwhich proclaim the unconquered spirit of discontent.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps, from the anxiety which we have expressed to prevent the petty\\r\\nmisfortunes, and unnecessary tears of children, it may be supposed\\r\\nthat we are disposed to humour them; far from it--We know too well\\r\\nthat a humoured child is one of the most unhappy beings in the world;\\r\\na burden to himself, and to his friends; capricious, tyrannical,\\r\\npassionate, peevish, sullen, and selfish.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn only child runs a dreadful chance of being spoiled. He is born a\\r\\nperson of consequence; he soon discovers his innate merit; every eye\\r\\nis turned upon him the moment he enters the room; his looks, his\\r\\ndress, his appetite, are all matters of daily concern to a whole\\r\\nfamily; his wishes are divined; his wants are prevented; his witty\\r\\nsayings are repeated in his presence; his smiles are courted; his\\r\\ncaresses excite jealousy, and he soon learns how to avail himself of\\r\\nhis central situation. His father and mother make him alternately\\r\\ntheir idol, and their plaything; they do not think of educating, they\\r\\nonly think of admiring him; they imagine that he is unlike all other\\r\\nchildren in the universe, and that his genius and his temper are\\r\\nindependent of all cultivation. But when this little paragon of\\r\\nperfection has two or three brothers and sisters, the scene changes;\\r\\nthe man of consequence dwindles into an insignificant little boy. We\\r\\nshall hereafter explain more fully the danger of accustoming children\\r\\nto a large share of our sympathy; we hope that the economy of kindness\\r\\nand caresses which we have recommended,[39] will be found to increase\\r\\ndomestic affection, and to be essentially serviceable to the temper.\\r\\nIn a future chapter, \"On Vanity, Pride, and Ambition,\" some remarks\\r\\nwill be found on the use and abuse of the stimuli of praise,\\r\\nemulation, and ambition. The precautions which we have already\\r\\nmentioned with respect to servants, and the methods that have been\\r\\nsuggested for inducing habitual and rational obedience, will also, we\\r\\nhope, be considered as serviceable to the temper, as well as to the\\r\\nunderstanding. Perpetual and contradictory commands and prohibitions,\\r\\nnot only make children disobedient, but fretful, peevish, and\\r\\npassionate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIdleness, amongst children, as amongst men, is the root of all evil,\\r\\nand leads to no evil more certainly than to ill temper. It is\\r\\nsaid,[40] that the late king of Spain was always so cross during\\r\\nPassion week, when he was obliged to abstain from his favourite\\r\\namusement of hunting, that none of his courtiers liked to approach his\\r\\nmajesty. There is a great similarity between the condition of a prince\\r\\nflattered by his courtiers, and a child humoured by his family; and we\\r\\nmay observe, that both the child and prince are most intolerable to\\r\\ntheir dependants and friends, when any of their daily amusements are\\r\\ninterrupted. It is not that the amusements are in themselves\\r\\ndelightful, but the pains and penalties of idleness are insupportable.\\r\\nWe have endeavoured to provide a variety of occupations, as well as of\\r\\namusements, for our young pupils,[41] that they may never know the\\r\\nmisery of the Spanish monarch. When children are occupied, they are\\r\\nindependent of other people, they are not obliged to watch for casual\\r\\nentertainment from those who happen to be unemployed, or who chance to\\r\\nbe in a humour to play with them; they have some agreeable object\\r\\ncontinually in view, and they feel satisfied with themselves. They\\r\\nwill not torment every body in the house with incessant requests. \"May\\r\\nI have this? Will you give me that? May I go out to see such a thing?\\r\\nWhen will it be dinner time? When will it be tea time? When will it be\\r\\ntime for me to go to supper?\" are the impatient questions of a child\\r\\nwho is fretful from having nothing to do. Idle children are eternal\\r\\npetitioners, and the refusals they meet with, perpetually irritate\\r\\ntheir temper. With respect to requests in general, we should either\\r\\ngrant immediately what a child desires, or we should give a decided\\r\\nrefusal. The state of suspense is not easily borne; the propriety or\\r\\nimpropriety of the request should decide us either to grant, or to\\r\\nrefuse it; and we should not set the example of caprice, or teach our\\r\\npupils the arts of courtiers, who watch the humour of tyrants. If we\\r\\nhappen to be busy, and a child comes with an eager request about some\\r\\ntrifle, it is easy so far to command our temper as to answer, \"I am\\r\\nbusy, don\\'t talk to me now,\" instead of driving the petitioner away\\r\\nwith harsh looks, and a peremptory refusal, which make as great an\\r\\nimpression as harsh words. If we are reasonable, the child will soon\\r\\nlearn to apply to us at proper times. By the same steady, gentle\\r\\nconduct, we may teach him to manage his love of talking with\\r\\ndiscretion, and may prevent those ineffectual exhortations to silence,\\r\\nwhich irritate the temper of the vivacious pupil. Expostulations, and\\r\\nangry exclamations, will not so effectually command from our pupils\\r\\ntemperance of tongue, as their own conviction that they are more\\r\\nlikely to gain attention from their friends, if they choose properly\\r\\ntheir seasons for conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo prevent, we cannot too often repeat it, is better than to punish,\\r\\nwithout humouring children; that is to say, without yielding to their\\r\\ncaprices, or to their _will_, when they express their wishes with\\r\\nimpatience, we may prevent many of those little inconveniences which\\r\\ntease and provoke the temper; any continual irritation exhausts our\\r\\npatience; acute pain can be endured with more fortitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have sometimes seen children become fretful from the constant\\r\\nteasing effect of some slight inconveniences in their dress; we have\\r\\npitied poor little boys, who were continually exhorted to produce\\r\\ntheir handkerchiefs, and who could scarcely ever get these\\r\\nhandkerchiefs out of the tight pockets into which they had been\\r\\nstuffed; into such pockets the hand can never enter, or withdraw\\r\\nitself, without as much difficulty as Trenck had in getting rid of his\\r\\nhandcuffs. The torture of tight shoes, of back-boards, collars, and\\r\\nstocks, we hope is nearly abandoned; surely all these are unnecessary\\r\\ntrials of fortitude; they exhaust that patience which might be\\r\\nexercised upon things of consequence. Count Rumford tells us, that he\\r\\nobserved a striking melioration in the temper of all the mendicants in\\r\\nthe establishment at Munich, when they were relieved from the\\r\\nconstant torments of rags and vermin.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people imagine, that early sufferings, that a number of small\\r\\ninconveniences, habitual severity of reproof, and frequent\\r\\ncontradiction and disappointment, inure children to pain, and\\r\\nconsequently improve their temper. Early sufferings, which are\\r\\nnecessary and inevitable, may improve children in fortitude; but the\\r\\ncontradictions and disappointments, which arise immediately from the\\r\\nwill of others, have not the same effect. Children, where their own\\r\\ninterests are concerned, soon distinguish between these two classes of\\r\\nevils; they submit patiently when they know that it would be in vain\\r\\nto struggle; they murmur and rebel, if they dare, whenever they feel\\r\\nthe hand of power press upon them capriciously. We should not invent\\r\\ntrials of temper for our pupils; if they can bear with good humour the\\r\\ncommon course of events, we should be satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tumbled down, and I _bored_ it very well,\" said a little boy of\\r\\nthree years old, with a look of great satisfaction. If this little boy\\r\\nhad been thrown down on purpose by his parents as a trial of temper,\\r\\nit probably would not have been borne so well. As to inconveniences,\\r\\nin general it is rather a sign of indolence, than a proof of good\\r\\ntemper in children, to submit to them quietly; if they can be remedied\\r\\nby exertion, why should they be passively endured? If they cannot be\\r\\nremedied, undoubtedly it is then better to abstract the attention from\\r\\nthem as much as possible, because this is the only method of lessening\\r\\nthe pain. Children should be assisted in making this distinction, by\\r\\nour applauding their exertions when they struggle against unnecessary\\r\\nevil, by our commending their patience whenever they endure inevitable\\r\\npain without complaints.\\r\\n\\r\\nIllness, for instance, is an inevitable evil. To prevent children from\\r\\nbecoming peevish, when they are ill, we should give our pity and\\r\\nsympathy with an increased appearance of affection, whenever they\\r\\nbear their illness with patience. No artifice is necessary; we need\\r\\nnot affect any increase of pity; patience and good humour in the\\r\\nsufferer, naturally excite the affection and esteem of the spectators.\\r\\nThe self-complacency, which the young patient must feel from a sense\\r\\nof his own fortitude, and the perception that he commands the willing\\r\\nhearts of all who attend him, are really alleviations of his bodily\\r\\nsufferings; the only alleviations which, in some cases, can possibly\\r\\nbe afforded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attention which is thought necessary in learning languages, often\\r\\nbecomes extremely painful to the pupils, and the temper is often hurt\\r\\nby ineffectual attempts to improve the understanding. We have\\r\\nendeavoured to explain the methods of managing[42] the attention of\\r\\nchildren with the least possible degree of pain. Yesterday a little\\r\\nboy of three years old, W----, was learning his alphabet from his\\r\\nfather; after he had looked at one letter for some time with great\\r\\nattention, he raised his eyes, and with a look of much good humour,\\r\\nsaid to his father, \"It makes me tired to stand.\" His father seated\\r\\nhim upon his knee, and told him that he did wisely in telling what\\r\\ntired him: the child, the moment he was seated, fixed his attentive\\r\\neyes again upon his letters with fresh eagerness, and succeeded.\\r\\nSurely it was not humouring this boy to let him sit down when he was\\r\\ntired. If we teach a child that our assistance is to be purchased by\\r\\nfretful entreaties; if we show him, that we are afraid of a storm, he\\r\\nwill make use of our apprehensions to accomplish his purposes. On the\\r\\ncontrary, if he perceives that we can steadily resist his tears and\\r\\nill humour, and especially if we show indifference upon the occasion,\\r\\nhe will perceive that he had better dry his tears, suspend his rage,\\r\\nand try how far good humour will prevail. Children, who in every\\r\\nlittle difficulty are assisted by others, really believe that others\\r\\nare in fault whenever this assistance is not immediately offered. Look\\r\\nat a humoured child, for instance, trying to push a chair along the\\r\\ncarpet; if a wrinkle in the carpet stops his progress, he either beats\\r\\nthe chair, or instantly turns with an angry appealing look to his\\r\\nmother for assistance; and if she does not get up to help him, he will\\r\\ncry. Another boy, who has not been humoured, will neither beat the\\r\\nchair, nor angrily look round for help; but he will look immediately\\r\\nto see what it is that stops the chair, and when he sees the wrinkle\\r\\nin the carpet, he will either level or surmount the obstacle: during\\r\\nthis whole operation, he will not feel in the least inclined to cry.\\r\\nBoth these children might have had precisely the same original stock\\r\\nof patience; but by different management, the one would become\\r\\npassionate and peevish, the other both good humoured and persevering.\\r\\nThe pleasure of success pays children, as well as men, for long toil\\r\\nand labour. Success is the proper reward of perseverance; but if we\\r\\nsometimes capriciously grant, and sometimes refuse, our help, our\\r\\npupils cannot learn this important truth, and they imagine that\\r\\nsuccess depends upon the will of others, and not upon their own\\r\\nefforts. A child, educated by a fairy, who sometimes came with magic\\r\\naid to perform, and who was sometimes deaf to her call, would\\r\\nnecessarily become ill humoured.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral children, who were reading \"Evenings at Home,\" observed that\\r\\nin the story of Juliet and the fairy Order, \"it was wrong to make the\\r\\nfairy come whenever Juliet cried, and could not do her task, because\\r\\nthat was the way, said the children, to make the little girl ill\\r\\nhumoured.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have formerly observed that children, who live much with companions\\r\\nof their own age, are under but little habitual restraint as to their\\r\\ntempers; they quarrel, fight, and shake hands; they have long and loud\\r\\naltercations, in which the strongest voice often gets the better. It\\r\\ndoes not improve the temper to be overborne by petulance and clamour:\\r\\neven mild, sensible children, will learn to be positive if they\\r\\nconverse with violent dunces. In private families, where children mix\\r\\nin the society of persons of different ages, who encourage them to\\r\\nconverse without reserve, they may meet with exact justice; they may\\r\\nsee that their respective talents and good qualities are appreciated;\\r\\nthey may acquire the habit of arguing without disputing; and they may\\r\\nlearn that species of mutual forbearance in trifles, as well as in\\r\\nmatters of consequence, which tends so much to domestic happiness. Dr.\\r\\nFranklin, in one of his letters to a young female friend, after\\r\\nanswering some questions which she had asked him, apparently referring\\r\\nto an argument which had passed some time before, concludes with this\\r\\ncomprehensive compliment: \"So, you see, I think you had the best of\\r\\nthe _argument_; and, as you give it up in complaisance to the company,\\r\\nI think you had also the best of the _dispute_.\" When young people\\r\\nperceive that they gain credit by keeping their temper in\\r\\nconversation, they will not be furious for victory, because\\r\\nmoderation, during the time of battle, can alone entitle them to the\\r\\nhonours of a triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is particularly necessary for girls to acquire command of temper in\\r\\narguing, because much of the effect of their powers of reasoning, and\\r\\nof their wit, when they grow up, will depend upon the gentleness and\\r\\ngood humour with which they conduct themselves. A woman, who should\\r\\nattempt to thunder like Demosthenes, would not find her eloquence\\r\\nincrease her domestic happiness. We by no means wish that women should\\r\\nyield their better judgment to their fathers or husbands; but, without\\r\\nusing any of that debasing cunning which Rousseau recommends, they may\\r\\nsupport the cause of reason with all the graces of female gentleness.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man, in a furious passion, is terrible to his enemies; but a woman\\r\\nin a passion, is disgusting to her friends; she loses the respect due\\r\\nto her sex, and she has not masculine strength and courage to enforce\\r\\nany other species of respect. These circumstances should be considered\\r\\nby writers who advise that no difference should be made in the\\r\\neducation of the two sexes. We cannot help thinking that their\\r\\nhappiness is of more consequence than their speculative rights, and we\\r\\nwish to educate women so that they may be happy in the situations in\\r\\nwhich they are most likely to be placed. So much depends upon the\\r\\ntemper of women, that it ought to be most carefully cultivated in\\r\\nearly life; girls should be more inured to restraint than boys,\\r\\nbecause they are likely to meet with more restraint in society. Girls\\r\\nshould learn the habit of bearing slight reproofs, without thinking\\r\\nthem matters of great consequence; but then they should always be\\r\\npermitted to state their arguments, and they should perceive that\\r\\njustice is shown to them, and that they increase the affection and\\r\\nesteem of their friends by command of temper. Many passionate men are\\r\\nextremely good natured, and make amends for their extravagances by\\r\\ntheir candour, and their eagerness to please those whom they have\\r\\ninjured during their fits of anger. It is said, that the servants of\\r\\nDean Swift used to throw themselves in his way whenever he was in a\\r\\npassion, because they knew that his generosity would recompense them\\r\\nfor standing the full fire of his anger. A woman, who permitted\\r\\nherself to treat her servants with ill humour, and who believed that\\r\\nshe could pay them for ill usage, would make a very bad mistress of a\\r\\nfamily; her husband and her children would suffer from her ill temper,\\r\\nwithout being recompensed for their misery. We should not let girls\\r\\nimagine that they can balance ill humour by some good quality or\\r\\naccomplishment; because, in fact, there are none which can supply the\\r\\nwant of temper in the female sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nA just idea of the nature of dignity, opposed to what is commonly\\r\\ncalled _spirit_, should be given early to our female pupils. Many\\r\\nwomen, who are not disposed to violence of temper, affect a certain\\r\\ndegree of petulance, and a certain stubbornness of opinion, merely\\r\\nbecause they imagine that to be gentle, is to be mean; and that to\\r\\nlisten to reason, is to be deficient in spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnlarging the understanding of young women, will prevent them from the\\r\\ntrifling vexations which irritate those who have none but trifling\\r\\nobjects. We have observed that concerted trials of temper are not\\r\\nadvantageous for very young children. Those trials which are sometimes\\r\\nprepared for pupils at a more advanced period of education, are not\\r\\nalways more happy in their consequences. We make trifles appear\\r\\nimportant; and then we are surprised that they are thought so.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Kames tells us that he was acquainted with a gentleman, who,\\r\\nthough otherwise a man of good understanding, did not show his good\\r\\nsense in the education of his daughters temper. \"He had,\" says Lord\\r\\nKames, \"three comely daughters, between twelve and sixteen, and to\\r\\ninure them to bear disappointments, he would propose to make a visit\\r\\nwhich he knew would delight them. The coach was bespoke, and the young\\r\\nladies, completely armed for conquest, were ready to take their seats.\\r\\nBut, behold! their father had changed his mind. This, indeed, was a\\r\\ndisappointment; but as it appeared to proceed from whim, or caprice,\\r\\nit might sour their temper, instead of improving it.\"[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why should a visit be made a matter of such mighty consequence to\\r\\ngirls? Why should it be a disappointment to stay at home? And why\\r\\nshould Lord Kames advise that disappointments should _be made to\\r\\nappear_ the effects of chance? This method of making things appear to\\r\\nbe what they are not, we cannot too often reprobate; it will not have\\r\\nbetter success in the education of the temper, than in the management\\r\\nof the understanding; it would ruin the one or the other, or both:\\r\\neven when promises are made with perfect good faith to young people,\\r\\nthe state of suspense which they create, is not serviceable to the\\r\\ntemper, and it is extremely difficult to promise proper rewards.[44]\\r\\nThe celebrated Serena surely established her reputation for good\\r\\ntemper, without any very severe trials. Our standard of female\\r\\nexcellence, is evidently changed since the days of Griselda; but we\\r\\nare inclined to think, that even in these degenerate days, public\\r\\namusements would not fill the female imagination, if they were not\\r\\nearly represented as such charming things, such great rewards to\\r\\ngirls, by their imprudent friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temper depends much upon the understanding; and whenever we give\\r\\nour pupils, whether male or female, false ideas of pleasure, we\\r\\nprepare for them innumerable causes of discontent. \"You ought to be\\r\\nabove such things! You ought not to let yourself be vexed by such\\r\\ntrifles!\" are common expressions, which do not immediately change the\\r\\nirritated person\\'s feelings. You must alter the habits of thinking;\\r\\nyou must change the view of the object, before you can alter the\\r\\nfeelings. Suppose a girl has, from the conversation of all her\\r\\nacquaintance, learned to imagine that there is some vast pleasure in\\r\\ngoing to a masquerade; it is in vain to tell her, in the moment that\\r\\nshe is disappointed about her masquerade dress, that \"it is a trifle,\\r\\nand she ought to be above trifles.\" She cannot be above them at a\\r\\nmoment\\'s warning: but if she had never been inspired with a violent\\r\\ndesire to go to a masquerade, the disappointment would really appear\\r\\ntrifling. We may calculate the probability of any person\\'s\\r\\nmortification, by observing the vehemence of their hopes; thus we are\\r\\nled to observe, that the imagination influences the temper. Upon this\\r\\nsubject we shall speak more fully when we treat of Imagination and\\r\\nJudgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo measure the degree of indulgence which may be safe for any given\\r\\npupils, we must attend to the effect produced by pleasure upon their\\r\\nimagination and temper. If a small diminution of their usual\\r\\nenjoyments disturbs them, they have been rendered not too happy, but\\r\\ntoo susceptible. Happy people, who have resources in their own power,\\r\\ndo not feel every slight variation in external circumstances. We may\\r\\nsafely allow children to be as happy as they possibly can be without\\r\\nsacrificing the future to the present. Such prosperity will not\\r\\nenervate their minds.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe make this assertion with some confidence, because experience has in\\r\\nmany instances confirmed our opinion. Amongst a large family of\\r\\nchildren, who have never been tormented with artificial trials of\\r\\ntemper, and who have been made as happy as it was in the power of\\r\\ntheir parents to make them, there is not one ill tempered child. We\\r\\nhave examples every day before us of different ages from three years\\r\\nold to fifteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore parents adopt either Epicurean or Stoical doctrines in the\\r\\neducation of the temper, it may be prudent to calculate the\\r\\nprobabilities of the good and evil, which their pupils are likely to\\r\\nmeet with in life. The Sybarite, whose night\\'s rest was disturbed by a\\r\\ndoubled rose leaf, deserves to be pitied almost as much as the young\\r\\nman who, when he was benighted in the snow, was reproached by his\\r\\nsevere father for having collected a heap of snow to make himself a\\r\\npillow. Unless we could for ever ensure the bed of roses to our\\r\\npupils, we should do very imprudently to make it early necessary to\\r\\ntheir repose: unless the pillow of snow is likely to be their lot, we\\r\\nneed not inure them to it from their infancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[39] V.

Chapter on Rewards and Punishments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII.\\r\\n\\r\\nON OBEDIENCE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nObedience has been often called the virtue of childhood. How far it is\\r\\nentitled to the name of virtue, we need not at present stop to\\r\\nexamine. Obedience is expected from children long before they can\\r\\nreason upon the justice of our commands; consequently it must be\\r\\ntaught as a habit. By associating pleasure with those things which we\\r\\nfirst desire children to do, we should make them necessarily like to\\r\\nobey; on the contrary, if we begin by ordering them to do what is\\r\\ndifficult and disagreeable to them, they must dislike obedience. The\\r\\npoet seems to understand this subject when he says,\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Or bid her wear your necklace rowed with pearl,\\r\\n    You\\'ll find your Fanny an obedient girl.\"[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe taste for a necklace rowed with pearl, is not the _first_ taste,\\r\\neven in girls, that we should wish to cultivate; but the poet\\'s\\r\\n_principle_ is good, notwithstanding. Bid your child do things that\\r\\nare agreeable to him, and you may be sure of his obedience. Bid a\\r\\nhungry boy eat apple pye; order a shivering urchin to warm himself at\\r\\na good fire; desire him to go to bed when you see him yawn with\\r\\nfatigue, and by such seasonable commands you will soon form\\r\\nassociations of pleasure in his mind, with the voice and tone of\\r\\nauthority. This tone should never be threatening, or alarming; it\\r\\nshould be gentle, but decided. Whenever it becomes necessary that a\\r\\nchild should do what he feels disagreeable, it is better to make him\\r\\nsubmit at once to necessity, than to create any doubt and struggle in\\r\\nhis mind, by leaving him a possibility of resistance. Suppose a\\r\\nlittle boy wishes to sit up later than the hour at which you think\\r\\nproper that he should go to bed; it is most prudent to take him to bed\\r\\nat the appointed time, without saying one word to him, either in the\\r\\nway of entreaty or command. If you entreat, you give the child an idea\\r\\nthat he has it in his power to refuse you: if you command, and he does\\r\\nnot instantly obey, you hazard your authority, and you teach him that\\r\\nhe can successfully set his will in opposition to yours. The boy\\r\\nwishes to sit up; he sees no reason, in the moral fitness of things,\\r\\nwhy he should go to bed at one hour more than at another; all he\\r\\nperceives is, that such is your will. What does he gain by obeying\\r\\nyou? Nothing: he loses the pleasure of sitting up half an hour longer.\\r\\nHow can you then expect that he should, in consequence of these\\r\\nreasonings, give up his obvious immediate interest, and march off to\\r\\nbed heroically at the word of command? Let him not be put to the\\r\\ntrial; when he has for some time been regularly taken to bed at a\\r\\nfixed hour, he will acquire the habit of thinking that he must go at\\r\\nthat hour: association will make him expect it; and if his experience\\r\\nhas been uniform, he will, without knowing why, think it necessary\\r\\nthat he should do as he has been used to do. When the habit of\\r\\nobedience to customary necessity is thus formed, we may, without much\\r\\nrisk, engraft upon it obedience to the voice of authority. For\\r\\ninstance, when the boy hears the clock strike, the usual signal for\\r\\nhis departure, you may, if you see that he is habitually ready to obey\\r\\nthis signal, associate your commands with that to which he has already\\r\\nlearned to pay attention. \"Go; it is time that you should go to bed\\r\\nnow,\" will only seem to the child a confirmation of the sentence\\r\\nalready pronounced by the clock: by degrees, your commands, after they\\r\\nhave been regularly repeated, when the child feels no hope of evading\\r\\nthem, will, even in new circumstances, have from association the power\\r\\nof compelling obedience.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever we desire a child to do any thing, we should be perfectly\\r\\ncertain, not only that it is a thing which he is capable of doing, but\\r\\nalso, that it is something we can, in case it comes to that ultimate\\r\\nargument, force him to do. You cannot oblige a child to stand up, if\\r\\nhe has a mind to sit down; or to walk, if he does not choose to exert\\r\\nhis muscles for that purpose: but you can absolutely prevent him from\\r\\ntouching whatever you desire him not to meddle with, by your superior\\r\\nstrength. It is best, then, to begin with prohibitions; with such\\r\\nprohibitions as you can, and will, steadily persevere to enforce: if\\r\\nyou are not exact in requiring obedience, you will never obtain it\\r\\neither by persuasion or authority. As it will require a considerable\\r\\nportion of time and unremitting attention, to enforce the punctual\\r\\nobservance of a variety of prohibitions, it will, for your own sake,\\r\\nbe most prudent to issue as few edicts as possible, and to be sparing\\r\\nin the use of the imperative mood. It will, if you calculate the\\r\\ntrouble you must take day after day to watch your pupil, cost you less\\r\\nto begin by arranging every circumstance in your power, so as to\\r\\nprevent the necessity of trusting to laws what ought to be guarded\\r\\nagainst by precaution. Do you, for instance, wish to prevent your son\\r\\nfrom breaking a beautiful china jar in your drawing room; instead of\\r\\nforbidding him to touch it, put it out of his reach.--Would you\\r\\nprevent your son from talking to servants; let your house, in the\\r\\nfirst place, be so arranged, that he shall never be obliged to pass\\r\\nthrough any rooms where he is likely to meet with servants; let all\\r\\nhis wants be gratified without their interference; let him be able to\\r\\nget at his hat without asking the footman to reach it for him, from\\r\\nits inaccessible height.[46] The simple expedient of hanging the hat\\r\\nin a place where the boy can reach it, will save you the trouble of\\r\\ncontinually repeating, \"Don\\'t ask William, child, to reach your hat;\\r\\ncan\\'t you come and ask me?\" Yes, the boy can come and ask you; but if\\r\\nyou are busy, you will not like to go in quest of the hat; your\\r\\nreluctance will possibly appear in your countenance, and the child,\\r\\nwho understands the language of looks better than that of words, will\\r\\nclearly comprehend, that you are displeased with him at the very\\r\\ninstant that he is fulfilling the letter of the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lady, who was fond of having her house well arranged, discovered, to\\r\\nthe amazement of her acquaintance, the art of making all her servants\\r\\nkeep every thing in its place. Even in the kitchen, from the most\\r\\nminute article to the most unwieldy, every thing was invariably to be\\r\\nfound in its allotted station; the servants were thought miracles of\\r\\nobedience; but, in fact, they obeyed because it was the easiest thing\\r\\nthey could possibly do. Order was made more convenient to them than\\r\\ndisorder, and, with their utmost ingenuity to save themselves trouble,\\r\\nthey could not invent places for every thing more appropriate than\\r\\nthose which had been assigned by their mistress\\'s legislative economy.\\r\\nIn the same manner we may secure the _orderly_ obedience of children,\\r\\nwithout exhausting their patience or our own. Rousseau advises, that\\r\\nchildren should be governed solely by the necessity of circumstances;\\r\\nbut there are _one and twenty_ excellent objections to this system;\\r\\nthe first being, that it is impossible: of this Rousseau must have\\r\\nbeen sensible in the trials which he made as a preceptor. When he had\\r\\nthe management of a refractory child, he found himself obliged to\\r\\ninvent and arrange a whole drama, by artificial experience, to\\r\\nconvince his little pupil, that he had better not walk out in the\\r\\nstreets of Paris alone; and that, therefore, he should wait until his\\r\\npupil could conveniently accompany him. Rousseau had prepared the\\r\\nneighbours on each side of the street to make proper speeches as his\\r\\npupil passed by their doors, which alarmed and piqued the boy\\r\\neffectually. At length the child was met at a proper time, by a friend\\r\\nwho had been appointed to watch him; and thus he was brought home\\r\\nsubmissive. This scene, as Rousseau observes, was admirably well\\r\\nperformed;[47] but what occasion could there be for so much\\r\\ncontrivance and deceit? If his pupil had not been uncommonly deficient\\r\\nin penetration, he would soon have discovered his preceptor in some of\\r\\nhis artifices; then adieu both to obedience and confidence. A false\\r\\nidea of the pleasures of liberty misled Rousseau. Children have not\\r\\nour abstract ideas of the pleasures of liberty; they do not, until\\r\\nthey have suffered from ill judged restraints, feel any strong desire\\r\\nto exercise what we call free will; liberty is, with them, the liberty\\r\\nof doing certain specific things which they have found to be\\r\\nagreeable; liberty is not the general idea of pleasure, in doing\\r\\nwhatever they WILL _to do_. Rousseau desires, that _we should not let\\r\\nour pupil know, that in doing our will he is obedient to us_. But why?\\r\\nWhy should we not let a child know the truth? If we attempt to conceal\\r\\nit, we shall only get into endless absurdities and difficulties. Lord\\r\\nKames tells us, that he was acquainted with a couple, who, in the\\r\\neducation of their family, pursued as much as possible Rousseau\\'s\\r\\nplan. One evening, as the father was playing at chess with a friend,\\r\\none of his children, a boy of about four years old, took a piece from\\r\\nthe board, and ran away to play with it. The father, whose principles\\r\\nwould not permit him to assert his right to his own chessman, began to\\r\\nbargain for his property with his son. \"Harry,\" said he, \"let us have\\r\\nback the man, and there\\'s an apple for you.\" The apple was soon\\r\\ndevoured, and the child returned to the chess board, and kidnapped\\r\\nanother chessman. What this man\\'s ransom might be, we are not yet\\r\\ninformed; but Lord Kames tells us, that the father was obliged to\\r\\nsuspend his game at chess until his son was led away to his supper.\\r\\nDoes it seem just, that parents should become slaves to the liberties\\r\\nof their children? If one set of beings or another should sacrifice a\\r\\nportion of happiness, surely those who are the most useful, and the\\r\\nmost capable of increasing the knowledge and the pleasures of life,\\r\\nhave some claim to a preference; and when the power is entirely in\\r\\ntheir own hands, it is most probable that they will defend their own\\r\\ninterests. We shall not, like many who have spoken of Rousseau, steal\\r\\nfrom him after having abused him. His remarks upon the absurd and\\r\\ntyrannical restraints which are continually imposed upon children by\\r\\nthe folly of nurses and servants, or by the imprudent anxiety of\\r\\nparents and preceptors, are excellent. Whenever Rousseau is in the\\r\\nright, his eloquence is irresistible.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo determine what degree of obedience it is just to require from\\r\\nchildren, we must always consider what degree of reason they possess:\\r\\nwhenever we can use reason, we should never use force; it is only\\r\\nwhilst children are too young to comprehend reason,[48] that we should\\r\\nexpect from them implicit submission. The means which have been\\r\\npointed out for teaching the habit of obedience, must not be depended\\r\\nupon for teaching any thing more than the mere habit. When children\\r\\nbegin to reason, they do not act merely from habit; they will not be\\r\\nobedient at this age, unless their understanding is convinced that it\\r\\nis for their advantage to be so. Wherever we can explain the reasons\\r\\nfor any of our requests, we should attempt it; but whenever these\\r\\ncannot be fully explained, it is better not to give a partial\\r\\nexplanation; it will be best to say steadily, \"You cannot understand\\r\\nthis now, you will, perhaps, understand it some time hence.\" Whenever\\r\\nwe tell children, that we forbid them to do such and such things for\\r\\nany particular reason, we must take care that the reason assigned is\\r\\nadequate, and that it will in all cases hold good. For instance, if we\\r\\nforbid a boy to eat unripe fruit, _because it will make him ill_, and\\r\\nif afterwards the boy eat some unripe gooseberries without feeling ill\\r\\nin consequence of his disobedience, he will doubt the truth of the\\r\\nperson who prohibited unripe fruit; he will rather trust his own\\r\\npartial experience than any assertions. The idea of _hurting his\\r\\nhealth_, is a general idea, which he does not yet comprehend. It is\\r\\nmore prudent to keep him out of the way of unripe gooseberries, than\\r\\nto hazard at once his obedience and his integrity. We need not\\r\\nexpatiate further; the instance we have given, may be readily applied\\r\\nto all cases in which children have it in their power to disobey with\\r\\n_immediate_ impunity, and, what is still more dangerous, with the\\r\\ncertainty of obtaining immediate pleasure. The gratification of their\\r\\nsenses, and the desire of bodily exercise, ought never to be\\r\\nunnecessarily restrained. Our pupils should distinctly perceive, that\\r\\nwe wish to make them happy, and every instance, in which they discover\\r\\nthat obedience has really made them happier, will be more in our\\r\\nfavour, than all the lectures we could preach. From the past, they\\r\\nwill judge of the future. Children, who have for many years\\r\\nexperienced, that their parents have exacted obedience only to such\\r\\ncommands as proved to be ultimately wise and beneficial, will surely\\r\\nbe disposed from habit, from gratitude, and yet more from prudence, to\\r\\nconsult their parents in all the material actions of their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may observe, that the spirit of contradiction, which sometimes\\r\\nbreaks out in young people the moment they are able to act for\\r\\nthemselves, arises frequently from slight causes in their early\\r\\neducation. Children, who have experienced, that submission to the will\\r\\nof others has constantly made them unhappy, will necessarily, by\\r\\nreasoning inversely, imagine, that felicity consists in following\\r\\ntheir own free will.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French poet Boileau was made very unhappy by neglect and restraint\\r\\nduring his education: when he grew up, he would never agree with those\\r\\nwho talked to him of the pleasures of childhood.[49] \"Peut on,\" disoit\\r\\nce po\\xc3\\xabte amoureux de l\\'ind\\xc3\\xa9pendence, \"ne pas regarder comme un grand\\r\\nmalheur, le chagrin continuel et particulier \\xc3\\xa0 cet age, de ne jamais\\r\\nfaire sa volont\\xc3\\xa9?\" It was in vain, continues his biographer, to boast\\r\\nto him of the advantages of this happy constraint, which saves youth\\r\\nfrom so many follies. \"What signifies our knowing the value of our\\r\\nchains when we have shaken them off, if we feel nothing but their\\r\\nweight whilst we wear them?\" the galled poet used to reply. Nor did\\r\\nBoileau enjoy his freedom, though he thought with such horror of his\\r\\nslavery. He declared, that if he had it in his choice, either to be\\r\\nborn again upon the hard conditions of again going through his\\r\\nchildhood, or not to exist, he would rather not exist: but he was not\\r\\nhappy during any period of his existence; he quarrelled with all the\\r\\nseasons of life; \"all seemed to him equally disagreeable; youth,\\r\\nmanhood, and old age, are each subject, he observed, to impetuous\\r\\npassions, to care, and to infirmities.\" Hence we may conclude, that\\r\\nthe severity of his education had not succeeded in teaching him to\\r\\nsubmit philosophically to necessity, or yet in giving him much\\r\\nenjoyment from that _liberty_ which he so much coveted. Thus it too\\r\\noften happens, that an imaginary value is set upon the exercise of the\\r\\nfree will by those who, during their childhood, have suffered under\\r\\ninjudicious restrictions. Sometimes the love of free will is so\\r\\nuncontrollably excited, even during childhood, that it breaks out,\\r\\nunfortunately both for the pupils and the preceptors, in the\\r\\nformidable shape of obstinacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the faults to which children are subject, there is none which\\r\\nis more difficult to cure, or more easy to prevent, than obstinacy. As\\r\\nit is early observed by those who are engaged in education, it is\\r\\nsometimes supposed to be inherent in the temper; but, so far from\\r\\nbeing naturally obstinate, infants show those strong propensities to\\r\\nsympathy and imitation, which prepare them for an opposite character.\\r\\nThe folly of the nurse, however, makes an intemperate use of these\\r\\nhappy propensities. She perpetually torments the child to exert\\r\\nhimself for her amusement; all his senses and all his muscles she\\r\\ncommands. He must see, hear, talk, or be silent, move or be still,\\r\\nwhen she thinks proper; and often with the desire of amusing her\\r\\ncharge, or of showing him off to the company, she disgusts him with\\r\\nvoluntary exertion. Before young children have completely acquired the\\r\\nuse of their limbs, they cannot perform feats of activity or of\\r\\ndexterity at a moment\\'s warning. Their muscles do not instantaneously\\r\\nobey their will; the efforts they make are painful to themselves; the\\r\\nawkwardness of their attempts is painful to others; the delay of the\\r\\nbody is often mistaken for the reluctance of the mind; and the\\r\\nimpatient tutor pronounces the child to be obstinate, whilst all the\\r\\ntime he may be doing his utmost to obey. Instead of growing angry with\\r\\nthe helpless child, it would be surely more wise to assist his feeble\\r\\nand inexperienced efforts. If we press him to make unsuccessful\\r\\nattempts, we shall associate pain both with voluntary exertion and\\r\\nwith obedience.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle W---- (a boy of three years old) was one day asked by his\\r\\nfather to jump. The boy stood stock still. Perhaps he did not know the\\r\\nmeaning of the word jump. The father, instead of pressing him further,\\r\\nasked several other children who happened to be in the room to jump,\\r\\nand he jumped along with them: all this was done playfully. The little\\r\\nboy looked on silently for a short time, and seemed much pleased.\\r\\n\"Papa jumps!\" he exclaimed. His brother L---- lifted him up two or\\r\\nthree times; and he then tried to jump, and succeeded: from sympathy\\r\\nhe learned the command of the muscles which were necessary to his\\r\\njumping, and to his obedience. If this boy had been importuned, or\\r\\nforced to exert himself, he might have been thus taught obstinacy,\\r\\nmerely from the imprudent impatience of the spectators. The reluctance\\r\\nto stop when a child is once in motion, is often mistaken for\\r\\nobstinacy: when he is running, singing, laughing, or talking, if you\\r\\nsuddenly command him to stop, he cannot instantly obey you. If we\\r\\nreflect upon our own minds, we may perceive that we cannot, without\\r\\nconsiderable effort, turn our thoughts suddenly from any subject on\\r\\nwhich we have been long intent. If we have been long in a carriage,\\r\\nthe noise of the wheels sounds in our ear, and we seem to be yet going\\r\\non after the carriage has stopped. We do not pretend to found any\\r\\naccurate reasoning upon analogy; but we may observe, the difficulty\\r\\nwith which our minds are stopped or put in motion, resembles the\\r\\nvis-inerti\\xc3\\xa6 of the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nW---- (three years old) had for some minutes vociferated two or three\\r\\nwords of a song, until the noise could be no longer patiently endured;\\r\\nhis father called to him, and desired that he would not make so much\\r\\nnoise. W---- paused for a moment, but then went on singing the same\\r\\nwords. His brother said, Hush! W---- paused for another second or two;\\r\\nbut then went on with his roundelay. In his countenance there was not\\r\\nthe slightest appearance of ill humour. One of his sisters put him\\r\\nupon a board which was lying on the floor, and which was a little\\r\\nunsteady; as he walked cautiously along this board, his attention was\\r\\noccupied, and he forgot his song.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis inability suddenly to desist from any occupation, may easily grow\\r\\ninto obstinacy, because the pain of checking themselves will be great\\r\\nin children, and this pain will be associated with the commands of\\r\\nthose who govern them; it is better to stop them by presenting new\\r\\nobjects to their attention, than by the stimulus of a peremptory\\r\\nvoice. Children should never be accused of obstinacy; the accusation\\r\\ncannot cure, but may superinduce the disease. If, unfortunately, they\\r\\nhave been suffered to contract a disposition to this fault, it may be\\r\\ncured by a little patience and good temper. We have mentioned how\\r\\nexample and sympathy may be advantageously used; praise and looks of\\r\\naffection, which naturally express our feeling when children do right,\\r\\nencourage the slightest efforts to obey; but we must carefully avoid\\r\\nshowing any triumph in our victory over yielding stubbornness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, I knew that you would do what we desired at last, you might as\\r\\nwell have done it at first,\" is a common nursery-maid\\'s speech, which\\r\\nis well calculated to pique the pride of a half-subdued penitent. When\\r\\nchildren are made ashamed of submission, they will become intrepid,\\r\\nprobably unconquerable, rebels.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither rewards nor punishments will then avail; the pupil perceives,\\r\\nthat both the wit and the strength of his master are set in\\r\\ncompetition with his: at the expense of a certain degree of pain, he\\r\\nhas the power to resist as long as he thinks proper; and there is\\r\\nscarcely any degree of pain that a tutor dares to inflict, which an\\r\\nobstinate hero is not able to endure. With the spirit of a martyr, he\\r\\nsustains reproaches and torture. If, at length, the master changes his\\r\\ntone, and tries to soften and win the child to his purpose, his\\r\\nrewards are considered as bribes: if the boy really thinks that he is\\r\\nin the right to rebel, he must yield his sense of honour to the force\\r\\nof temptation when he obeys. If he has formed no such idea of honour,\\r\\nhe perhaps considers the reward as the price of his submission; and,\\r\\nupon a future occasion, he will know how to raise that price by\\r\\nprolonging his show of resistance. Where the child has formed a false\\r\\nidea of honour, his obstinacy is only mistaken resolution; we should\\r\\naddress ourselves to his understanding, and endeavour to convince him\\r\\nof his errour. Where the understanding is convinced, and the _habit_\\r\\nof opposition still continues, we should carefully avoid calling his\\r\\nfalse associations into action; we should not ask him to do any thing\\r\\nfor which he has acquired an habitual aversion; we should alter our\\r\\nmanner of speaking to him, that neither the tones of our voice, the\\r\\nwords, or the looks, which have been his customary signals for\\r\\nresistance, may recall the same feelings to his mind: placed in new\\r\\ncircumstances, he may acquire new habits, and his old associates will\\r\\nin time be forgotten. Sufficient time must, however, be allowed; we\\r\\nmay judge when it is prudent to try him on any old dangerous subjects,\\r\\nby many symptoms: by observing the degree of alacrity with which he\\r\\nobeys on indifferent occasions; by observing what degree of command he\\r\\nhas acquired over himself in general; by observing in what manner he\\r\\njudges of the conduct and temper of other children in similar\\r\\ncircumstances; by observing whether the consciousness of his former\\r\\nself continues in full force. Children often completely forget what\\r\\nthey have been.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere obstinacy arises from principle, if we may use the expression,\\r\\nit cannot be cured by the same means which are taken to cure that\\r\\nspecies of the disease which depends merely upon habit. The same\\r\\ncourage and fortitude which in one case we reprobate, and try to\\r\\nconquer with all our might, in the other we admire and extol. This\\r\\nshould be pointed out to children; and if they act from a love of\\r\\nglory, as soon as they perceive it, they will follow that course which\\r\\nwill secure to them the prize.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles XII. whom the Turks, when incensed by his disobedience to the\\r\\ngrand seignior, called Demirbash, or _head of iron_, showed early\\r\\nsymptoms of this headstrong nature; yet in his childhood, if his\\r\\npreceptor[50] named but glory, any thing could be obtained from\\r\\nCharles. Charles had a great aversion to learning Latin; but when he\\r\\nwas told that the kings of Poland and Denmark understood it, he began\\r\\nto study it in good earnest. We do not mean to infer, that emulation\\r\\nwith the kings of Poland and Denmark, was the best possible motive\\r\\nwhich Charles the Twelfth\\'s preceptor could have used, to make the\\r\\nyoung prince conquer his aversion to Latin; but we would point out,\\r\\nthat where the love of glory is connected with obstinate temper, the\\r\\npassion is more than a match for the temper. Let us but enlighten this\\r\\nlove of glory, and we produce magnanimity in the place of obstinacy.\\r\\nExamples, in conversation and in books, of great characters, who have\\r\\nnot been ashamed to change their opinions, and to acknowledge that\\r\\nthey have been mistaken, will probably make a great impression upon\\r\\nyoung people; they will from these learn to admire candour, and will\\r\\nbe taught, that it is _mean_ to persist in the wrong. Examples from\\r\\nbooks must, however, be also uniformly supported by examples in real\\r\\nlife; preceptors and parents must practise the virtues which they\\r\\npreach. It is said, that the amiable Fenelon acquired the most\\r\\npermanent influence over his pupil, by the candour with which he\\r\\nalways treated him. Fenelon did not think that he could lessen his\\r\\ndignity by confessing himself to be in the wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung people who have quick abilities, and who happen to live with\\r\\nthose who are inferiour to them either in knowledge or incapacity, are\\r\\napt to become positive and self-willed; they measure all the world by\\r\\nthe individuals with whom they have measured themselves; and, as they\\r\\nhave been convinced that they have been in the right in many cases,\\r\\nthey take it for granted that their judgment must be always\\r\\ninfallible. This disease may be easily cured; it is only necessary to\\r\\nplace the patient amongst his superiors in intellect, his own\\r\\nexperience will work his cure: he liked to follow his will, because\\r\\nhis judgment had taught him that he might trust more securely to the\\r\\n_tact_ of his own understanding, than to the decision of others. As\\r\\nsoon as he discovers more sense in the arguments of his companions, he\\r\\nwill listen to them, and if he finds their reason superior to his own,\\r\\nhe will submit. A preceptor, who wishes to gain ascendency over a\\r\\nclever positive boy, must reason with all possible precision, and must\\r\\nalways show that he is willing to be decided by the strongest\\r\\narguments which can be produced. If he ever prophesies, he sets his\\r\\njudgment at stake; therefore he should not prophesy about matters of\\r\\nchance, but rather in affairs where he can calculate with certainty.\\r\\nIf his prophecies are frequently accomplished, his pupil\\'s confidence\\r\\nin him will rapidly increase; and if he desires that confidence to be\\r\\npermanent, he will not affect mystery, but he will honestly explain\\r\\nthe circumstances by which he formed his opinions. Young people who\\r\\nare accustomed to hear and to give reasons for their opinions, will\\r\\nnot be violent and positive in assertions; they will not think that\\r\\nthe truth of any assertion can be manifested by repeating over the\\r\\nsame words a thousand times; they will not ask how many people are of\\r\\nthis or that opinion, but rather what arguments are produced on each\\r\\nside. There is very little danger that any people, whether young or\\r\\nold, should continue to be positive, who are in the habit of\\r\\nexercising their reasoning faculty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been often observed that extremely good humoured, complaisant\\r\\nchildren, when they grow up, become ill tempered; and young men who\\r\\nare generally liked in society as pleasant companions, become surly,\\r\\ntyrannical masters in their own families, positive about mere trifles,\\r\\nand anxious to subjugate the _wills_ of all who are any wise dependent\\r\\nupon them. This character has been nicely touched by de Boissy, in his\\r\\ncomedy called \"Dehors trompeurs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must observe, that whilst young people are in company, and under\\r\\nthe immediate influence of the excitements of novelty, numbers and\\r\\ndissipation, it is scarcely possible to form a just estimate of the\\r\\ngoodness of their temper. Young men who are the most ready to yield\\r\\ntheir inclinations to the humour of their companions, are not\\r\\ntherefore to be considered as of really compliant dispositions; the\\r\\nidle or indolent, who have no resources in their own minds, and no\\r\\nindependent occupations, are victims to the yawning demon of ennui the\\r\\nmoment they are left in solitude. They consequently dread so heartily\\r\\nto be left alone, that they readily give up a portion of their liberty\\r\\nto purchase the pleasures and mental support which society affords.\\r\\nWhen they give up their wishes, and follow the lead of the company,\\r\\nthey in fact give up but very little; their object is amusement; and\\r\\nthis obtained, their time is sacrificed without regret. On the\\r\\ncontrary, those who are engaged in literary or professional pursuits,\\r\\nset a great value upon their time, and feel considerable reluctance to\\r\\npart with it without some adequate compensation; they must\\r\\nconsequently be less complaisant companions, and by the generality of\\r\\nsuperficial observers, would be thought, perhaps, less complying in\\r\\ntheir tempers, than the idle and dissipated. But when the idle man has\\r\\npast the common season for dissipation, and is settled in domestic\\r\\nlife, his spirits flag from the want of his usual excitements; and, as\\r\\nhe has no amusements in his own family, to purchase by the polite\\r\\nsacrifice of his opinion or his will, he is not inclined to\\r\\ncomplaisance. The pleasures of exercising his free will, becomes\\r\\nimportant in his eyes; he has few pleasures, and of those few he is\\r\\ntenacious. He has been accustomed to submit to others in society; he\\r\\nis proud to be master at home; he has few emotions, and the emotion\\r\\ncaused by the exertion of command, becomes agreeable and necessary to\\r\\nhim. Thus many of the same causes which make a young man a pleasant\\r\\ncompanion abroad, tend naturally to make him a tyrant at home. This\\r\\nperversity and positiveness of temper, ultimately arise from the want\\r\\nof occupation, and from deficient energy of mind. We may guard against\\r\\nthese evils by education: when we see a playful, active child, we have\\r\\nlittle fear of his temper. \"Oh, he will certainly be good tempered, he\\r\\nis the most obedient, complying creature in the world, he\\'ll do any\\r\\nthing you ask him.\" But let us cultivate his understanding, and give\\r\\nhim tastes which shall occupy and interest him agreeably through life,\\r\\nor else this sweet, complying temper will not last till he is thirty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn ill cured obstinacy of temper, when it breaks out after young\\r\\npeople have arrived at years of discretion, is terrible. Those who\\r\\nattempt to conquer obstinacy in children by bodily pain, or by severe\\r\\npunishments of any kind, often appear to succeed, and to have entirely\\r\\neradicated, when they have merely suppressed, the disease for a time.\\r\\nAs soon as the child that is intimidated by force or fear, is relieved\\r\\nfrom restraint, he will resume his former habits; he may change the\\r\\nmode of showing it, but the disposition will continue the same. It\\r\\nwill appear in various parts of the conduct, as the limbs of the giant\\r\\nappeared unexpectedly at different periods, and in different parts of\\r\\nthe Castle of Otranto.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[45] Elegy on an old Beauty.

Charles XII. page 13.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nON TRUTH.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not necessary here to pronounce a panegyric upon truth; its use\\r\\nand value is thoroughly understood by all the world; but we shall\\r\\nendeavour to give some practical advice, which may be of service in\\r\\neducating children, not only to the love, but to the habits, of\\r\\nintegrity. These are not always found, as they ought to be,\\r\\ninseparable.\\r\\n\\r\\nRousseau\\'s eloquence, and Locke\\'s reasoning, have sufficiently\\r\\nreprobated, and it is to be hoped have exploded, the system of\\r\\nlecturing children upon morality; of giving them precepts and general\\r\\nmaxims which they do not understand, and which they cannot apply. We\\r\\nshall not produce long quotations from books which are in every body\\'s\\r\\nhands.[51] There is one particular in which Rousseau especially, and\\r\\nmost other authors who have written upon education, have given very\\r\\ndangerous counsel; they have counselled parents to teach truth by\\r\\nfalsehood. The privilege of using contrivance, and ingenious\\r\\ndeceptions, has been uniformly reserved for preceptors; and the\\r\\npupils, by moral delusions, and the theatric effect of circumstances\\r\\ntreacherously arranged, are to be duped, surprised, and cheated, into\\r\\nvirtue. The dialogue between the gardener and Emilius about the\\r\\nMaltese melon-seed, is an instance of this method of instruction.\\r\\nHonest Robert, the gardener, in concert with the tutor, tells poor\\r\\nEmilius a series of lies, prepares a garden, \"choice Maltese\\r\\nmelon-seed,\" and \"worthless beans,\" all to cheat the boy into just\\r\\nnotions of the rights of property, and the nature of exchange and\\r\\nbarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the _artificial course of experience_ in that excellent work\\r\\non education, Adele and Theodore, is defective upon the same\\r\\nprinciple. There should be no moral delusions; no _artificial_ course\\r\\nof experience; no plots laid by parents to make out the truth; no\\r\\nlistening fathers, mothers, or governesses; no pretended confidence,\\r\\nor perfidious friends; in one word, no falsehood should be practised:\\r\\nthat magic which cheats the senses, at the same time confounds the\\r\\nunderstanding. The spells of Prospero, the strangenesses of the isle,\\r\\nperplex and confound the senses and understanding of all who are\\r\\nsubjected to his magic, till at length, worked by force of wonders\\r\\ninto credulity, his captives declare that they will believe any thing;\\r\\n\"that there are men dewlapt like bulls; and what else does want\\r\\ncredit,\" says the Duke Anthonio, \"come to me, and I\\'ll be sworn \\'tis\\r\\ntrue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren, whose simplicity has been practised upon by the fabling\\r\\nmorality of their preceptors, begin by feeling something like the\\r\\nimplicit credulity of Anthonio; but the arts of the preceptors are\\r\\nquickly suspected by their subjects, and the charm is for ever\\r\\nreversed. When once a child detects you in falsehood, you lose his\\r\\nconfidence; his incredulity will then be as extravagant as his former\\r\\nbelief was gratuitous. It is in vain to expect, by the most eloquent\\r\\nmanifestoes, or by the most secret leagues offensive and defensive, to\\r\\nconceal your real views, sentiments, and actions, from children. Their\\r\\ninterest keeps their attention continually awake; not a word, not a\\r\\nlook, in which they are concerned, escapes them; they see, hear, and\\r\\ncombine, with sagacious rapidity; if falsehood be in the wind,\\r\\ndetection hunts her to discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonesty is the best policy, must be the maxim in education, as well as\\r\\nin all the other affairs of life. We must not only be exact in\\r\\nspeaking truth to our pupils, but to every body else; to acquaintance,\\r\\nto servants, to friends, to enemies. It is not here meant to enter any\\r\\noverstrained protest against the common phrases and forms of\\r\\npoliteness; the current coin may not be pure; but when once its alloy\\r\\nhas been ascertained, and its value appreciated, there is no fraud,\\r\\nthough there may be some folly, in continuing to trade upon equal\\r\\nterms with our neighbours, with money of high nominal, and scarcely\\r\\nany real, value. No fraud is committed by a gentleman\\'s saying he is\\r\\n_not at home_, because no deception is intended; the words are silly,\\r\\nbut they mean, and are understood to mean, nothing more than that the\\r\\nperson in question does not choose to see the visiters who knock at\\r\\nhis door. \"I am, sir, your obedient and humble servant,\" at the end of\\r\\na letter, does not mean that the person who signs the letter is a\\r\\nservant, or humble, or obedient, but it simply expresses that he knows\\r\\nhow to conclude his letter according to the usual form of civility.\\r\\nChange this absurd phrase, and welcome; but do not let us, in the\\r\\nspirit of Draco, make no distinction between errours and crimes. The\\r\\nfoibles of fashion or folly, are not to be treated with the\\r\\ndetestation due to hypocrisy and falsehood; if small faults are to\\r\\nincur such grievous punishments, there can, indeed, be none found\\r\\nsufficiently severe for great crimes; great crimes, consequently, for\\r\\nwant of adequate punishment, will increase, and the little faults,\\r\\nthat have met with disproportionate persecution, will become amiable\\r\\nand innocent in the eyes of commiserating human nature. It is not\\r\\ndifficult to explain to young people the real meaning, or rather the\\r\\nnonsense, of a few complimentary phrases; their integrity will not be\\r\\nincreased or diminished by either saying, or omitting to say, \"I am\\r\\nmuch obliged to you,\" or \"I shall be very happy to see you at dinner,\"\\r\\n&c. We do not mean to include in the harmless list of compliments, any\\r\\nexpressions which are meant to deceive; the common custom of the\\r\\ncountry, and of the society in which we live, sufficiently regulates\\r\\nthe style of complimentary language; and there are few so ignorant of\\r\\nthe world as seriously to misunderstand this, or to mistake civility\\r\\nfor friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a story told of a Chinese mandarin, who paid a visit to a\\r\\nfriend at Paris, at the time when Paris was the seat of politeness.\\r\\nHis well-bred host, on the first evening of his arrival, gave him a\\r\\nhandsome supper, lodged him in the best bed-chamber, and when he\\r\\nwished him a good night, amongst other civil things, said he hoped the\\r\\nmandarin would, during his stay at Paris, consider that house as his\\r\\nown. Early the next morning, the polite Parisian was awakened by the\\r\\nsound of loud hammering in the mandarin\\'s bed-chamber; on entering the\\r\\nroom, he found the mandarin and some masons hard at work, throwing\\r\\ndown the walls of the house. \"You rascals, are you mad?\" exclaimed the\\r\\nFrenchman to the masons. \"Not at all, my dear friend,\" said the\\r\\nChinese man, soberly, \"I set the poor fellows to work; this room is\\r\\ntoo small for my taste; you see I have lost no time in availing myself\\r\\nof your goodness. Did not you desire me to use this house as if it\\r\\nwere my own, during my stay at Paris?\" \"Assuredly, my dear friend, and\\r\\nso I hope you will,\" replied the French gentleman, \"the only\\r\\nmisfortune here is, that I did not understand Chinese, and that I had\\r\\nno interpreter.\" They found an interpreter, or a Chinese dictionary,\\r\\nand when the Parisian phrase was properly translated, the mandarin,\\r\\nwho was an honest man, begged his polite host\\'s pardon for having\\r\\npulled down the partition. It was rebuilt; the mandarin learned\\r\\nFrench, and the two friends continued upon the best terms with each\\r\\nother, during the remainder of the visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chesterfieldian system of endeavouring to please by dissimulation,\\r\\nis obviously distinguishable by any common capacity, from the usual\\r\\nforms of civility. There is no hope of educating young people to a\\r\\nlove of integrity in any family, where this practice is adopted. If\\r\\nchildren observe that their parents deceive common acquaintance, by\\r\\npretending to like the company, and to esteem the characters, of those\\r\\nwhom they really think disagreeable and contemptible, how can they\\r\\nlearn to respect truth? How can children believe in the praise of\\r\\ntheir parents, if they detect them in continual flattery towards\\r\\nindifferent people? It may be thought, by latitudinarians in\\r\\npoliteness, that we are too rigid in expecting this strict adherence\\r\\nto truth from people who live in society; it may be said, that in\\r\\nPractical Education, no such Utopian ideas of perfection should be\\r\\nsuggested. If we thought them Utopian, we certainly should not waste\\r\\nour time upon them; but we do not here speak theoretically of what may\\r\\nbe done, we speak of what has been done. Without the affectation of\\r\\nusing a more sanctified language than other people; without departing\\r\\nfrom the common forms of society; without any painful, awkward\\r\\nefforts, we believe that parents may, in all their conversation in\\r\\nprivate and in public, set their children the uniform example of truth\\r\\nand integrity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not mean that the example of parents can alone produce this\\r\\neffect; a number of other circumstances must be combined. Servants\\r\\nmust have no communication with children, if you wish to teach them\\r\\nthe habit of speaking truth. The education, and custom, and situation\\r\\nof servants, are at present such, that it is morally impossible to\\r\\ndepend upon their veracity in their intercourse with children.\\r\\nServants think it good natured to try to excuse and conceal all the\\r\\nlittle faults of children; to give them secret indulgences, and even\\r\\npositively to deny facts, in order to save them from blame or\\r\\npunishment. Even when they are not fond of the children, their example\\r\\nmust be dangerous, because servants do not scruple to falsify for\\r\\ntheir own advantage; if they break any thing, what a multitude of\\r\\nequivocations! If they neglect any thing, what a variety of excuses!\\r\\nWhat evasions in actions, or in words, do they continually invent!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be said, that as the Spartans taught their children to detest\\r\\ndrunkenness, by showing them intoxicated Helots, we can make falsehood\\r\\nodious and contemptible to our pupils, by the daily example of its\\r\\nmean deformity. But if children, before they can perceive the general\\r\\nadvantage of integrity, and before they can understand the utility of\\r\\ntruth, see the partial immediate success of falsehood, how can they\\r\\navoid believing in their own experience? If they see that servants\\r\\nescape blame, and screen themselves from punishment, by telling\\r\\nfalsehoods, they not only learn that falsehood preserves from pain,\\r\\nbut they feel obliged to those who practise it for their sakes; thus\\r\\nit is connected with the feelings of affection and of gratitude in\\r\\ntheir hearts, as well as with a sense of pleasure and safety. When\\r\\nservants have exacted promises from their _prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9s_, those promises\\r\\ncannot be broken without treachery; thus deceit brings on deceit, and\\r\\nthe ideas of truth and falsehood, become confused and contradictory.\\r\\nIn the chapter upon servants, we have expatiated upon this subject,\\r\\nand have endeavoured to point out how all communication between\\r\\nchildren and servants may be most effectually prevented. To that\\r\\nchapter, without further repetition, we refer. And now that we have\\r\\nadjusted the preliminaries concerning parents and servants, we may\\r\\nproceed with confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen young children first begin to speak, from not having a sufficient\\r\\nnumber of words to express their ideas, or from not having annexed\\r\\nprecise ideas to the words which they are taught to use, they\\r\\nfrequently make mistakes, which are attributed to the desire of\\r\\ndeceiving. We should not precipitately suspect them of falsehood; it\\r\\nis some time before they perfectly understand what we mean by truth.\\r\\nSmall deviations should not be marked with too much rigour; but\\r\\nwhenever a child relates _exactly_ any thing which he has seen, heard,\\r\\nor felt, we should listen with attention and pleasure, and we should\\r\\nnot show the least doubt of his veracity. Rousseau is perfectly right\\r\\nin advising, that children should never be questioned in any\\r\\ncircumstances upon which it can be their interest to deceive. We\\r\\nshould, at least, treat children with the same degree of wise lenity,\\r\\nwhich the English law extends to all who have arrived at years of\\r\\ndiscretion. No criminal is bound to accuse himself. If any mischief\\r\\nhas been committed, we should never, when we are uncertain by whom it\\r\\nhas been done, either directly accuse, or betray injurious suspicions.\\r\\nWe should neither say to the child, \"I believe you have done this,\"\\r\\nnor, \"I believe you have not done this;\" we should say nothing; the\\r\\nmischief is done, we cannot repair it: because a glass is broken, we\\r\\nneed not spoil a child; we may put glasses out of his reach in future.\\r\\nIf it should, however, happen, that a child voluntarily comes to us\\r\\nwith a history of an accident, may no love of goods or chattels, of\\r\\nwindows, of china, or even of looking-glasses, come in competition\\r\\nwith our love of truth? An angry word, an angry look, may intimidate\\r\\nthe child, who has summoned all his little courage to make this\\r\\nconfession. It is not requisite that parents should pretend to be\\r\\npleased and gratified with the destruction of their furniture, but\\r\\nthey may, it is to be hoped, without dissimulation, show that they\\r\\nset more value upon the integrity of their children, than upon a\\r\\nlooking-glass, and they will \"keep their temper still, though china\\r\\nfall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nH----, one day when his father and mother were absent from home, broke\\r\\na looking-glass. As soon as he heard the sound of the returning\\r\\ncarriage, he ran and posted himself at the hall door. His father, the\\r\\nmoment he got out of the carriage, beheld his erect figure, and pale,\\r\\nbut intrepid countenance. \"Father,\" said the boy, \"I have _broke_ the\\r\\nbest looking-glass in your house!\" His father assured him, that he\\r\\nwould rather all the looking-glasses in his house should be broken,\\r\\nthan that one of his children should attempt to make an excuse. H----\\r\\nwas most agreeably relieved from his anxiety by the kindness of his\\r\\nfather\\'s voice and manner, and still more so, perhaps, by perceiving\\r\\nthat he rose in his esteem. When the glass was examined, it appeared\\r\\nthat the boy had neglected to produce all the circumstances in his own\\r\\nfavour. Before he had begun to play at ball, he had had the precaution\\r\\nto turn the back of the looking-glass towards him; his ball, however,\\r\\naccidentally struck against the wooden back, and broke the glass.\\r\\nH---- did not make out this favourable state of the case for himself\\r\\nat first; he told it simply after the business was settled, seeming\\r\\nmuch more interested about the fate of the glass, than eager to\\r\\nexculpate himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no great danger of teaching children to do mischief by this\\r\\nindulgence to their accidental misfortunes. When they break, or waste\\r\\nany thing, from pure carelesness, let them, even when they speak the\\r\\ntruth about it, suffer the natural consequences of their carelesness;\\r\\nbut at the same time praise their integrity, and let them distinctly\\r\\nfeel the difference between the slight inconvenience to which they\\r\\nexpose themselves by speaking the truth, and the great disgrace to\\r\\nwhich falsehood would subject them. The pleasure of being esteemed,\\r\\nand trusted, is early felt, and the consciousness of deserving\\r\\nconfidence is delightful to children; but their young fortitude and\\r\\ncourage should never be exposed to severe temptations. It is not\\r\\nsufficient to excite an admiration of truth by example, by eloquent\\r\\npraise, or by the just rewards of esteem and affection; we must take\\r\\ncare to form the habits at the same time that we inspire the love of\\r\\nthis virtue. Many children admire truth, and feel all the shame of\\r\\ntelling falsehoods, who yet, either from habit or from fear, continue\\r\\nto tell lies. We must observe, that though the taste for praise is\\r\\nstrong in childhood, yet it is not a match for any of the bodily\\r\\nappetites, when they are strongly excited. Those children, who are\\r\\nrestrained as to the choice, or the quantity, of their food, usually\\r\\nthink that eating is a matter of vast consequence, and they are\\r\\nstrongly tempted to be dishonest to gratify their appetites. Children\\r\\ndo not understand the prudential maxims concerning health, upon which\\r\\nthese restraints are founded; and if they can, \"by any indirection,\"\\r\\nobtain things which gratify their palate, they will. On the contrary,\\r\\nyoung people who are regularly let to eat and drink as much as they\\r\\nplease, can have no temptation from hunger and thirst, to deceive; if\\r\\nthey partake of the usual family meals, and if there are no whimsical\\r\\ndistinctions between wholesome and unwholesome dishes, or epicurean\\r\\ndistinctions between rarities and plain food, the imagination and the\\r\\npride of children will not be roused about eating. Their pride is\\r\\npiqued, if they perceive that they are prohibited from touching what\\r\\n_grown up people_ are privileged to eat; their imagination is set to\\r\\nwork by seeing any extraordinary difference made by judges of eating\\r\\nbetween one species of food and another. In families where a regularly\\r\\ngood table is kept, children accustomed to the sight and taste of all\\r\\nkinds of food, are seldom delicate, capricious, or disposed to exceed;\\r\\nbut in houses where entertainments are made from time to time with\\r\\ngreat bustle and anxiety, fine clothes, and company-manners, and\\r\\ncompany-faces, and all that politeness can do to give the appearance\\r\\nof festivity, deceive children at least, and make them imagine that\\r\\nthere is some extraordinary joy in seeing a greater number of dishes\\r\\nthan usual upon the table. Upon these occasions, indeed, the pleasure\\r\\nis to them substantial; they eat more, they eat a greater variety, and\\r\\nof things that please them better than usual; the pleasure of eating\\r\\nis associated with unusual cheerfulness, and thus the imagination, and\\r\\nthe reality, conspire to make them epicures. To these children, the\\r\\ntemptations to deceive about sweetmeats and dainties are beyond\\r\\nmeasure great, especially as ill-bred strangers commonly show their\\r\\naffection for them by pressing them to eat what they are not allowed\\r\\nto say \"_if you please_\" to. Rousseau thinks all children are\\r\\ngluttons. All children may be rendered gluttons; but few, who are\\r\\nproperly treated with respect to food, and who have any literary\\r\\ntastes, can be in danger of continuing to be fond of eating. We\\r\\ntherefore, without hesitation, recommend it to parents never to hazard\\r\\nthe truth and honour of their pupils by prohibitions, which seldom\\r\\nproduce any of the effects that are expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren are sometimes injudiciously restrained with regard to\\r\\nexercise; they are required to promise to keep within certain\\r\\nboundaries when they are sent out to play; these promises are often\\r\\nbroken with impunity, and thus the children learn habits of successful\\r\\ndeceit. Instead of circumscribing their play grounds, as they are\\r\\nsometimes called, by narrow inconvenient limits, we should allow them\\r\\nas much space as we can with convenience, and at all events exact no\\r\\npromises. We should absolutely make it impossible for them to go\\r\\nwithout detection into any place which we forbid. It requires some\\r\\npatience and activity in preceptors to take all the necessary\\r\\nprecautions in issuing orders, but these precautions will be more\\r\\nuseful in preserving the integrity of their pupils, than the most\\r\\nsevere punishments that can be devised. We are not so unreasonable as\\r\\nto expect, with some theoretic writers on education, that tutors and\\r\\nparents should sacrifice the whole of their time to the convenience,\\r\\namusement, and education of their pupils. This would be putting one\\r\\nset of beings \"_sadly over the head of another_:\" but if parents\\r\\nwould, as much as possible, mix their occupations and recreations with\\r\\nthose of their children, besides many other advantages which have been\\r\\nelsewhere pointed out with respect to the improvement of the\\r\\nunderstanding, they would secure them from many temptations to\\r\\nfalsehood. They should be encouraged to talk freely of all their\\r\\namusements to their parents, and to ask them for whatever they want to\\r\\ncomplete their little inventions. Instead of banishing all the freedom\\r\\nof wit and humour, by the austerity of his presence, a preceptor, with\\r\\nsuperior talents, and all the resources of property in his favour,\\r\\nmight easily become the _arbiter deliciarum_ of his pupils.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen young people begin to taste the pleasures of praise, and to feel\\r\\nthe strong excitations of emulation and ambition, their integrity is\\r\\nexposed to a new species of temptation. They are tempted, not only by\\r\\nthe hope of obtaining \"well-earned praise,\" but by the desire to\\r\\nobtain praise without the labour of earning it. In large schools,\\r\\nwhere boys assist each other in their literary exercises, and in all\\r\\nprivate families where masters are allowed to show off the\\r\\naccomplishments of young gentlemen and ladies, there are so many\\r\\ntemptations to fraudulent exhibitions, that we despair of guarding\\r\\nagainst their consequences. The best possible method is to inspire\\r\\nchildren with a generous contempt for flattery, and to teach them to\\r\\njudge impartially of their own merits. If we are exact in the measure\\r\\nof approbation which we bestow, they will hence form a scale by which\\r\\nthey can estimate the sincerity of other people. It is said[52] that\\r\\nthe preceptor of the duke of Burgundy succeeded so well in inspiring\\r\\nhim with disdain for unmerited praise, that when the duke was only\\r\\nnine years old, he one day called his tutor to account for having\\r\\nconcealed some of his childish faults; and when this promising boy,\\r\\nand singular prince, was asked \"why he disliked one of his courtiers,\"\\r\\nhe answered, \"Because he flatters me.\" Anecdotes like these will make\\r\\na useful impression upon children. The life of Cyrus, in the\\r\\nCyrop\\xc3\\xa6dia; several passages in Plutarch\\'s Lives; and the lively,\\r\\ninteresting picture which Sully draws of his noble-hearted master\\'s\\r\\nlove of truth, will strongly command the admiration of young people,\\r\\nif they read them at a proper time of life. We must, however, wait for\\r\\nthis proper time; for if these things are read too early, they lose\\r\\nall their effect. Without any lectures upon the beauty of truth, we\\r\\nmay, now and then in conversation, when occurrences in real life\\r\\nnaturally lead to the subject, express with energy our esteem for\\r\\nintegrity. The approbation which we bestow upon those who give proofs\\r\\nof integrity, should be quite in a different tone, in a much higher\\r\\nstyle of praise, than any commendations for trifling accomplishments;\\r\\nhence children will become more ambitious to obtain a reputation for\\r\\ntruth, than for any other less honourable and less honoured\\r\\nqualification.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will venture to give two or three slight instances of the\\r\\nunaffected truth and simplicity of mind, which we have seen in\\r\\nchildren educated upon these principles. No good-natured reader will\\r\\nsuspect, that they are produced from ostentation: whenever the\\r\\nchildren, who are mentioned, see this in print, it is ten to one that\\r\\nthey will not be surprised at their own good deeds. They will be a\\r\\nlittle surprised, probably, that it should have been thought worth\\r\\nwhile to record things, which are only what they see and feel every\\r\\nday. It is this character of every-day goodness which we wish to\\r\\nrepresent; not any fine thoughts, fine sentiments, or fine actions,\\r\\nwhich come out for holyday admiration. We wish that parents, in\\r\\nreading any of these little anecdotes, may never exclaim, \"Oh that\\'s\\r\\ncharming, that\\'s surprising _for a child_!\" but we wish that they may\\r\\nsometimes smile, and say \"That\\'s very natural; I am sure _that_ is\\r\\nperfectly true; my little boy, or my little girl, say and do just such\\r\\nthings continually.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch, 1792. We were at Clifton; the river Avon ran close under the\\r\\nwindows of our house in Prince\\'s Place, and the children used to be\\r\\nmuch amused with looking at the vessels which came up the river. One\\r\\nnight a ship, that was sailing by the windows, fired some of her guns;\\r\\nthe children, who were looking out of the windows, were asked \"why the\\r\\nlight was seen when the guns were fired, before the noise was heard?\"\\r\\nC----, who at this time was nine years old, answered, \"Because light\\r\\ncomes quicker to the eye, than sound to the ear.\" Her father was\\r\\nextremely pleased with this answer; but just as he was going to kiss\\r\\nher, the little girl said, \"Father, the reason of my knowing it, was,\\r\\nthat L---- (her elder brother) just before had told it to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is, it is usually found, most temptation for children to deceive\\r\\nwhen they are put in competition with each other, when their ambition\\r\\nis excited by the same object; but if the transient glory of excelling\\r\\nin quickness, or abilities of any sort, be much inferiour to the\\r\\npermanent honour which is secured by integrity, there is, even in\\r\\ncompetition, no danger of unfair play.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarch, 1792. One evening ---- called the children round the tea-table,\\r\\nand told them the following story, which he had just met with in \"The\\r\\nCuriosities of Literature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the queen of Sheba went to visit king Solomon, she one day\\r\\npresented herself before his throne with a wreath of real flowers in\\r\\none hand, and a wreath of artificial flowers in the other hand; the\\r\\nartificial flowers were made so exactly to resemble nature, that at\\r\\nthe distance at which they were held from Solomon, it was scarcely\\r\\npossible that his eye could distinguish any difference between them\\r\\nand the natural flowers; nor could he, at the distance at which they\\r\\nwere held from him, know them asunder by their smell. \"Which of these\\r\\ntwo wreaths,\" demanded the queen of Sheba, \"is the work of nature?\"\\r\\nSolomon reflected for some minutes; and how did he discover which was\\r\\nreal? S---- (five years old) _replied_, \"Perhaps he went out of the\\r\\nroom very _softly_, and if the woman stood near the door, as he went\\r\\nnear her, he might _see better_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ But Solomon was not to move from his place.\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._. Then he might wait till the woman was tired of holding them,\\r\\nand then perhaps she might lay them down on the table, and then\\r\\nperhaps he might see better.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Well, C----, what do you say?\\r\\n\\r\\n_C----._ I think he might have looked at the stalks, and have seen\\r\\nwhich looked stiff like wire, and which were bent down by the weight\\r\\nof the natural flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Well, H----?\\r\\n\\r\\n_H----._ (ten years old.) I think he might send for a great pair of\\r\\nbellows, and blow, blow, till the real leaves dropped off.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ But would it not have been somewhat uncivil of Solomon to\\r\\n_blow, blow_, with his great pair of bellows, full in the queen of\\r\\nSheba\\'s face?\\r\\n\\r\\n_H----._ (doubting.) Yes, yes. Well, then he might have sent for a\\r\\ntelescope, or a magnifying glass, and looked through it; and then he\\r\\ncould have seen which were the real flowers, and which were\\r\\nartificial.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Well, B----, and what do you say?\\r\\n\\r\\n_B----._ (eleven years old.) He might have waited till the queen moved\\r\\nthe flowers, and then, if he listened, he might hear the rustling of\\r\\nthe artificial ones.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ S----, have you any thing more to say?\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----_ repeated the same thing that B---- had said; his attention was\\r\\ndissipated by hearing the other children speak. During this pause,\\r\\nwhilst S---- was trying to collect his thoughts, Mrs. E---- whispered\\r\\nto somebody near her, and accidentally said the word _animals_ loud\\r\\nenough to be overheard.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Well, H----, you look as if you had something to say?\\r\\n\\r\\n_H----._ Father, I heard my mother say something, and _that_ made me\\r\\nthink of the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. E---- shook hands with H----, and praised him for this instance\\r\\nof integrity. H---- then said that \"he supposed Solomon thought of\\r\\nsome _animal_ which would feed upon flowers, and sent it to the two\\r\\nnosegays; and then the animal would stay upon the real flowers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ What animal?\\r\\n\\r\\n_H----._ A fly.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Think again.\\r\\n\\r\\n_H----._ A bee.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story says that Solomon, seeing some bees hover about the window,\\r\\nordered the window to be thrown open, and watched upon which wreath of\\r\\nflowers the bee settled.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 1st, 1796. S---- (nine years old) when he was reading in Ovid\\r\\nthe fable of Perseus and Andromeda, said that he wondered that Perseus\\r\\nfought with the monster; he wondered that Perseus did not turn him\\r\\ninto stone at once with his Gorgon shield. We believe that S---- saw\\r\\nthat his father was pleased with this observation. A few days\\r\\nafterwards somebody in the family recollected Mr. E----\\'s having said,\\r\\nthat when he was a boy he thought Perseus a simpleton for not making\\r\\nuse of the Gorgon\\'s head to turn the monster into stone. We were not\\r\\nsure whether S---- had heard Mr. E---- say this or not; Mr. E----\\r\\nasked him whether he recollected to have heard any such thing. S----\\r\\nanswered, without hesitation, that he did remember it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen children have formed habits of speaking truth, and when we see\\r\\nthat these habits are grown quite easy to them, we may venture to\\r\\nquestion them about their thoughts and feelings; this must, however,\\r\\nbe done with great caution, but without the appearance of anxiety or\\r\\nsuspicion. Children are alarmed if they see that you are very anxious\\r\\nand impatient for their answer; they think that they hazard much by\\r\\ntheir reply; they hesitate, and look eagerly in your face, to discover\\r\\nby your countenance what they ought to think and feel, and what sort\\r\\nof answer you expect. All who are governed by any species of fear are\\r\\ndisposed to equivocation. Amongst the lower class of Irish labourers,\\r\\nand _under-tenants_, a class of people who are much oppressed, you can\\r\\nscarcely meet with any man who will give you a direct answer to the\\r\\nmost indifferent question; their whole ingenuity, and they have a\\r\\ngreat deal of ingenuity, is upon the _qui vive_ with you the instant\\r\\nyou begin to speak; they either pretend not to hear, that they may\\r\\ngain time to think, whilst you repeat your question, or they reply to\\r\\nyou with a fresh question, to draw out your remote meaning; for they,\\r\\njudging by their own habits, always think you have a remote meaning,\\r\\nand they never can believe that your words have no intention to\\r\\nensnare. Simplicity puzzles them much more than wit: for instance, if\\r\\nyou were to ask the most direct and harmless question, as, \"Did it\\r\\nrain yesterday?\" the first answer would probably be, \"Is it yesterday\\r\\nyou mean?\" \"Yes.\" \"Yesterday! No, please your honour, I was not at the\\r\\nbog at all yesterday. Wasn\\'t I after setting my potatoes? Sure I did\\r\\nnot know your honour wanted me at all yesterday. Upon my conscience,\\r\\nthere\\'s not a man in the country, let alone all Ireland, I\\'d sooner\\r\\nserve than your honour any day in the year, and they have belied me\\r\\nthat went behind my back to tell your honour the contrary. If your\\r\\nhonour sent after me, sure I never _got the word_, I\\'ll take my\\r\\naffidavit, or I\\'d been at the bog.\" \"My good friend, I don\\'t know what\\r\\nyou mean about the bog; I only ask you whether it rained yesterday.\"\\r\\n\"Please your honour, I couldn\\'t get a car and horse any way, to draw\\r\\nhome my little straw, or I\\'d have had the house thatched long ago.\"\\r\\n\"Cannot you give me a plain answer to this plain question? Did it rain\\r\\nyesterday?\" \"Oh sure, I wouldn\\'t go to tell your honour a lie about\\r\\nthe matter. Sarrah much it rained yesterday after twelve o\\'clock,\\r\\nbarring a few showers; but in the night there was a great fall of rain\\r\\nany how; and that was the reason prevented my going to Dublin\\r\\nyesterday, for fear the mistress\\'s band-box should get wet upon my\\r\\ncars. But, please your honour, if your honour\\'s displeased about it,\\r\\nI\\'ll not be waiting for a loading; I\\'ll take my car and go to Dublin\\r\\nto-morrow for the slates, if that be what your honour means. Oh, sure\\r\\nI would not tell a lie for the entire price of the slates; I know very\\r\\nwell it didn\\'t rain to call rain yesterday. But after twelve o\\'clock,\\r\\nI don\\'t say I noticed one way or other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this perverse and ludicrous method of beating about the bush, the\\r\\nman would persist till he had fairly exhausted your patience; and all\\r\\nthis he would do, partly from cunning, and partly from that\\r\\napprehension of injustice which he has been taught to feel by hard\\r\\nexperience. The effects of the example of their parents is early and\\r\\nmost strikingly visible in the children of this class of people in\\r\\nIreland. The children, who are remarkably quick and intelligent, are\\r\\nuniversally addicted to lying. We do not here scruple or hesitate in\\r\\nthe choice of our terms, because we are convinced that this\\r\\nunqualified assertion would not shock the feelings of the parties\\r\\nconcerned. These poor children are not brought up to think falsehood a\\r\\ndisgrace; they are praised for the ingenuity with which they escape\\r\\nfrom the cross examination of their superiors; and their capacities\\r\\nare admired in proportion to the _acuteness_, or, as their parents\\r\\npronounce it, \\'_cuteness_, of their equivocating replies. Sometimes\\r\\n(the _gar\\xc3\\xa7on_[53]) the little boy of the family is despatched by his\\r\\nmother to the landlord\\'s neighbouring bog or turf rick, to _bring\\r\\nhome_, in their phraseology, in ours to _steal_, a few turf; if, upon\\r\\nthis expedition, the little Spartan be detected, he is tolerably\\r\\ncertain of being whipped by his mother, or some of his friends, upon\\r\\nhis return home. \"Ah, ye little brat! and what made ye tell the\\r\\ngentleman when he met ye, ye rogue, that ye were going to the rick?\\r\\nAnd what business had ye to go and belie me to his honour, ye\\r\\nunnatural piece of goods! I\\'ll teach ye to make mischief through the\\r\\ncountry! So I will. Have ye got no better sense and manners at this\\r\\ntime o\\'day, than to behave, when one trusts ye abroad, so like an\\r\\ninnocent?\" An innocent in Ireland, as formerly in England, (witness\\r\\nthe Rape of the Lock) is synonymous with a fool. \"And fools and\\r\\ninnocents shall still believe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe associations of pleasure, of pride and gayety, are so strong in\\r\\nthe minds of these well educated children, that they sometimes expect\\r\\nthe very people who suffer by their dishonesty, should sympathise in\\r\\nthe self-complacency they feel from roguery. A gentleman riding near\\r\\nhis own house in Ireland, saw a cow\\'s head and fore feet appear at the\\r\\n_top of a ditch_, through a gap in the hedge by the road\\'s side, at\\r\\nthe same time he heard a voice alternately threatening and encouraging\\r\\nthe cow; the gentleman rode up closer to the scene of action, and he\\r\\nsaw a boy\\'s head appear behind the cow. \"My good boy,\" said he,\\r\\n\"that\\'s a fine cow.\" \"Oh, faith, that she is,\" replied the boy, \"and\\r\\nI\\'m teaching her to get her own living, please your honour.\" The\\r\\ngentleman did not precisely understand the meaning of the expression,\\r\\nand had he directly asked for an explanation, would probably have died\\r\\nin ignorance; but the boy, proud of his cow, encouraged an exhibition\\r\\nof her talents: she was made to jump across the ditch several times,\\r\\nand this adroitness in breaking through fences, was termed \"getting\\r\\nher own living.\" As soon as the cow\\'s education is finished, she may\\r\\nbe sent loose into the world to provide for herself; turned to graze\\r\\nin the poorest pasture, she will be able and willing to live upon the\\r\\nfat of the land.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is curious to observe how regularly the same moral causes produce\\r\\nthe same temper and character. We talk of climate, and frequently\\r\\nattribute to climate the different dispositions of different nations:\\r\\nthe climate of Ireland, and that of the West Indies, are not precisely\\r\\nsimilar, yet the following description, which Mr. Edwards, in his\\r\\nhistory of the West Indies, gives of the propensity to falsehood\\r\\namongst the negro slaves, might stand word for word for a character of\\r\\nthat class of the Irish people who, until very lately, actually, not\\r\\nmetaphorically, called themselves _slaves_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If a negro is asked even an indifferent question by his master, he\\r\\nseldom gives an immediate reply; but affecting not to understand what\\r\\nis said, compels a repetition of the question, that he may have time\\r\\nto consider, not what is the true answer, but what is the most politic\\r\\none for him to give.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Edwards assures us, that many of these unfortunate negroes learn\\r\\ncowardice and falsehood after they become slaves. When they first come\\r\\nfrom Africa, many of them show \"a frank and fearless temper;\"[54] but\\r\\nall distinction of character amongst the native Africans, is soon lost\\r\\nunder the levelling influence of slavery. Oppression and terror\\r\\nnecessarily produce meanness and deceit in all climates, and in all\\r\\nages; and wherever fear is the governing motive in education, we must\\r\\nexpect to find in children a propensity to dissimulation, if not\\r\\nconfirmed habits of falsehood. Look at the true born Briton under the\\r\\ngovernment of a tyrannical pedagogue, and listen to the language of\\r\\n_in-born_ truth; in the whining tone, in the pitiful evasions, in the\\r\\nstubborn falsehoods which you hear from the school-boy, can you\\r\\ndiscover any of that innate dignity of soul which is the boasted\\r\\nnational characteristic? Look again; look at the same boy in the\\r\\ncompany of those who inspire no terror; in the company of his\\r\\nschool-fellows, of his friends, of his parents; would you know him to\\r\\nbe the same being? his countenance is open; his attitude erect; his\\r\\nvoice firm; his language free and fluent; his thoughts are upon his\\r\\nlips; he speaks truth without effort, without fear. Where individuals\\r\\nare oppressed, or where they believe that they are oppressed, they\\r\\ncombine against their oppressors, and oppose cunning and falsehood to\\r\\npower and force; they think themselves released from the compact of\\r\\ntruth with their masters, and bind themselves in a strict league with\\r\\neach other; thus school-boys hold no faith with their schoolmaster,\\r\\nthough they would think it shameful to be dishonourable amongst one\\r\\nanother. We do not think that these maxims are the peculiar growth of\\r\\nschools; in private families the same feelings are to be found under\\r\\nthe same species of culture: if preceptors or parents are unjust or\\r\\ntyrannical, their pupils will contrive to conceal from them their\\r\\nactions and their thoughts. On the contrary, in families where\\r\\nsincerity has been encouraged by the voice of praise and affection, a\\r\\ngenerous freedom of conversation and countenance appears, and the\\r\\nyoung people talk to each other, and to their parents, without\\r\\ndistinction or reserve; without any distinction but such as superior\\r\\nesteem and respect dictate. These are feelings totally distinct from\\r\\nservile fear: these feelings inspire the love of truth, the ambition\\r\\nto acquire and to preserve character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe value of a character for truth, should be distinctly felt by\\r\\nchildren in their own family: whilst they were very young, we advised\\r\\nthat their integrity should not be tempted; as they grow up, trust\\r\\nshould by degrees be put in them, and we should distinctly explain to\\r\\nthem, that our confidence is to be deserved before it can be given.\\r\\nOur belief in any person\\'s truth, is not a matter of affection, but of\\r\\nexperience and necessity; we cannot doubt the assertions of any person\\r\\nwhom we have found to speak uniformly the truth; we cannot believe any\\r\\nperson, let us wish to do it ever so much, if we have detected him in\\r\\nfalsehoods. Before we have had experience of a person\\'s integrity, we\\r\\nmay hope, or take it for granted, that he is perfectly sincere and\\r\\nhonest; but we cannot feel more than _belief upon trust_, until we\\r\\nhave actually seen his integrity tried. We should not pretend that we\\r\\nhave faith in our pupils before we have tried them; we may hope from\\r\\ntheir habits, from the examples they have seen, and from the\\r\\nadvantageous manner in which truth has always been represented to\\r\\nthem, that they will act honourably; this hope is natural and just,\\r\\nbut confidence is another feeling of the mind. The first time we trust\\r\\na child, we should not say, \"I am sure you will not deceive me; I can\\r\\ntrust you with any thing in the world.\" This is flattery or folly; it\\r\\nis paying beforehand, which is not the way to get business done; why\\r\\ncannot we, especially as we are teaching truth, say the thing that\\r\\nis--\"I _hope_ you will not deceive me. If I find that you may be\\r\\ntrusted, you know I shall be able to trust you another time: this must\\r\\ndepend upon you, not entirely upon me.\" We must make ourselves certain\\r\\nupon these occasions, how the child conducts himself; nor is it\\r\\nnecessary to use any artifice, or to affect, from false delicacy, any\\r\\nsecurity that we do not feel; it is better openly to say, \"You see, I\\r\\ndo you the justice to examine carefully, how you have conducted\\r\\nyourself; I wish to be able to trust you another time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be said, that this method of strict inquiry reduces a trust to\\r\\nno trust at all, and that it betrays suspicion. If you examine\\r\\nevidently with the belief that a child has deceived you, certainly you\\r\\nbetray injurious suspicion, and you educate the child very ill; but if\\r\\nyou feel and express a strong desire to find that your pupil has\\r\\nconducted himself honourably, he will be glad and proud of the\\r\\nstrictest scrutiny; he will feel that he has earned your future\\r\\nconfidence, and this confidence, which he clearly knows how he has\\r\\nobtained, will be more valuable to him than all the belief upon trust\\r\\nwhich you could affect to feel. By degrees, after your pupil has\\r\\ntaught you to depend upon him, your confidence will prevent the\\r\\nnecessity of any examination into his conduct. This is the just and\\r\\ndelightful reward of integrity: children know how to feel and\\r\\nunderstand it thoroughly: besides the many restraints from which our\\r\\nconfidence will naturally relieve them, they feel the pride for being\\r\\ntrusted; the honour of having a character for integrity: nor can it be\\r\\ntoo strongly impressed upon their minds, that this character must be\\r\\npreserved, as it was obtained, by their own conduct. If one link in\\r\\nthe chain of confidence be broken, the whole is destroyed. Indeed,\\r\\nwhere habits of truth are early formed, we may safely depend upon\\r\\nthem. A young person, who has never deceived, would see, that the\\r\\nfirst step in falsehood costs too much to be hazarded. Let this appear\\r\\nin the form of calculation, rather than of sentiment. To habit, to\\r\\nenthusiasm, we owe much of all our virtues--to reason more; and the\\r\\nmore of them we owe to reason, the better. Habit and enthusiasm are\\r\\nsubject to sudden or gradual changes--but reason continues for ever\\r\\nthe same. As the understanding unfolds, we should fortify all our\\r\\npupil\\'s habits; and virtuous enthusiasm, by the conviction of their\\r\\nutility, of their being essential to the happiness of society in\\r\\ngeneral, and conducive immediately to the happiness of every\\r\\nindividual. Possessed of this conviction, and provided with\\r\\nsubstantial arguments in its support, young people will not be exposed\\r\\nto danger, either from sophistry or ridicule.\\r\\n\\r\\nRidicule certainly is not the test of truth; but it is a test which\\r\\ntruth sometimes finds it difficult to stand. Vice never \"bolts her\\r\\narguments\" with more success, than when she assumes the air of\\r\\nraillery, and the tone of gayety. All vivacious young people are fond\\r\\nof wit; we do not mean children, for they do not understand it. Those\\r\\nwho have the best capacities, and the strictest habits of veracity,\\r\\noften appear to common observers absolutely stupid, from their\\r\\naversion to any play upon words, and from the literal simplicity with\\r\\nwhich they believe every thing that is asserted. A remarkably\\r\\nintelligent little girl of four years old, but who had never in her\\r\\nown family been used to the common phrases which sometimes pass for\\r\\nhumour, happened to hear a gentleman say, as he looked out of the\\r\\nwindow one rainy morning, \"It rains cats and dogs to-day.\" The child,\\r\\nwith a surprised, but believing look, immediately went to look out of\\r\\nthe window to see the phenomenon. This extreme simplicity in\\r\\nchildhood, is sometimes succeeded in youth by a strong taste for wit\\r\\nand humour. Young people are, in the first place, proud to show that\\r\\nthey understand them; and they are gratified by the perception of a\\r\\nnew intellectual pleasure. At this period of their education, great\\r\\nattention must be paid to them, lest their admiration for wit and\\r\\nfrolic should diminish their reverence and their love for sober truth.\\r\\nIn many engaging characters in society, and in many entertaining\\r\\nbooks, deceit and dishonesty are associated with superior abilities,\\r\\nwith ease and gayety of manners, and with a certain air of frank\\r\\ncarelessness, which can scarcely fail to please. Gil Blas,[55] Tom\\r\\nJones, Lovelace, Count Fathom, are all of this class of characters.\\r\\nThey should not be introduced to our pupils till their habits of\\r\\nintegrity are thoroughly formed; and till they are sufficiently\\r\\nskilful in analysing their own feelings, to distinguish whence their\\r\\napprobation and pleasure in reading of these characters arise. In\\r\\nbooks, we do not actually suffer by the tricks of rogues, or by the\\r\\nlies they tell. Hence their truth is to us a quality of no value; but\\r\\ntheir wit, humour, and the ingenuity of their contrivances, are of\\r\\ngreat value to us, because they afford us entertainment. The most\\r\\nhonest man in the universe may not have had half so many adventures as\\r\\nthe greatest rogue; in a romance, the history upon oath of all the\\r\\nhonest man\\'s bargains and sales, law-suits and losses; nay, even a\\r\\ncomplete view of his ledger and day-book, together with the regular\\r\\nbalancings of his accounts, would probably not afford quite so much\\r\\nentertainment, even to a reader of the most unblemished integrity and\\r\\nphlegmatic temper, as the adventures of Gil Blas, and Jonathan Wild,\\r\\nadorned with all the wit of Le Sage, and humour of Fielding. When Gil\\r\\nBlas lays open his whole heart to us, and tells us all his sins,\\r\\nunwhipt of justice, we give him credit for making us his confidant,\\r\\nand we forget that this sincerity, and these liberal confessions, are\\r\\nnot characteristic of the hero\\'s disposition, but essential only to\\r\\nthe novel. The novel writer could not tell us all he had to say\\r\\nwithout this dying confession, and inconsistent openness, from his\\r\\naccomplished villain. The reader is ready enough to forgive, having\\r\\nnever been duped. When young people can make all these reflections for\\r\\nthemselves, they may read Gil Blas with as much safety as the Life of\\r\\nFranklin, or any other the most moral performance. \"Tout est sain aux\\r\\nsains,\"[56] as Madame de Sevigne very judiciously observes, in one of\\r\\nher letters upon the choice of books for her grand-daughter. We refer\\r\\nfor more detailed observations upon this subject to the chapter upon\\r\\nBooks. But we cannot help here reiterating our advice to preceptors,\\r\\nnot to force the detestable characters, which are sometimes held up to\\r\\nadmiration in ancient and modern history, upon the common sense, or,\\r\\nif they please, the moral feelings, of their pupils. The bad actions\\r\\nof _great_ characters, should not be palliated by eloquence, and fraud\\r\\nand villainy should never be explained away by the hero\\'s or warrior\\'s\\r\\ncode; a code which confounds all just ideas of right and wrong. Boys,\\r\\nin reading the classics, must read of a variety of crimes; but that is\\r\\nno reason that they should approve of them, or that their tutors\\r\\nshould undertake to vindicate the cause of falsehood and treachery. A\\r\\ngentleman, who has taught his sons Latin, has uniformly pursued the\\r\\npractice of abandoning to the just and prompt indignation of his\\r\\nyoung pupils all the ancient heroes who are deficient in moral\\r\\nhonesty: his sons, in reading Cornelius Nepos, could not absolutely\\r\\ncomprehend, that the treachery of Themistocles or of Alcibiades could\\r\\nbe applauded by a wise and polished nation. Xenophon has made an\\r\\neloquent attempt to explain the nature of military good faith.\\r\\nCambyses tells his son, that, in taking advantage of an enemy, a man\\r\\nmust be \"crafty, deceitful, a dissembler, a thief, and a robber.\" Oh\\r\\nJupiter! exclaims the young Cyrus, what a man, my father, you say I\\r\\nmust be! And he very sensibly asks his father, why, if it be necessary\\r\\nin some cases to ensnare and deceive men, he had not in his childhood\\r\\nbeen taught by his preceptors the art of doing harm to his\\r\\nfellow-creatures, as well as of doing them good. \"And why,\" says\\r\\nCyrus, \"have I always been punished whenever I have been discovered in\\r\\npractising deceit?\" The answers of Cambyses are by no means\\r\\nsatisfactory upon this subject; nor do we think that the conversation\\r\\nbetween the old general and Mr. Williams,[57] could have made the\\r\\nmatter perfectly intelligible to the young gentleman, whose scrupulous\\r\\nintegrity made him object to the military profession.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is certain, that many persons of strict honour and honesty in some\\r\\npoints, on others are utterly inconsistent in their principles. Thus\\r\\nit is said, that private integrity and public corruption frequently\\r\\nmeet in the same character: thus some gentlemen are jockies, and they\\r\\nhave a convenient latitude of conscience as jockies, whilst they would\\r\\nnot for the universe cheat a man of a guinea in any way but in the\\r\\nsale of a horse: others in gambling, others in love, others in war,\\r\\nthink all stratagems fair. We endeavour to think that these are all\\r\\nhonourable men; but we hope, that we are not obliged to lay down rules\\r\\nfor the formation of such moral prodigies in a system of practical\\r\\neducation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are aware, that with children[58] who are educated at public\\r\\nschools, truth and integrity cannot be taught precisely in the same\\r\\nmanner as in private families; because ushers and schoolmasters cannot\\r\\npay the same hourly attention to each of their pupils, nor have they\\r\\nthe command of all the necessary circumstances.--There are, however,\\r\\nsome advantages attending the early commerce which numbers of children\\r\\nat public seminaries have with each other; they find that no society\\r\\ncan subsist without truth; they feel the utility of this virtue, and,\\r\\nhowever they may deal with their masters, they learn to speak truth\\r\\ntowards each other.--This partial species of honesty, or rather of\\r\\nhonour, is not the very best of its kind, but it may easily be\\r\\nimproved into a more rational principle of action. It is illiberal to\\r\\nassert, that any virtue is to be taught only by one process of\\r\\neducation: many different methods of education may produce the same\\r\\neffects. Men of integrity and honour have been formed both by private\\r\\nand public education; neither system should be exclusively supported\\r\\nby those who really wish well to the improvement of mankind. All the\\r\\nerrours of each system should be impartially pointed out, and such\\r\\nremedies as may most easily be adopted with any hope of success,\\r\\nshould be proposed. We think, that if parents paid sufficient\\r\\nattention to the habits of their children, from the age of three to\\r\\nseven years old, they would be properly prepared for public education;\\r\\nthey would not then bring with them to public schools all that they\\r\\nhave learned of vice and falsehood in the company of servants.[59] We\\r\\nhave purposely repeated all this, in hopes of impressing it strongly.\\r\\nMay we suggest to the masters of these important seminaries, that\\r\\nGreek and Latin, and all the elegance of classical literature, are\\r\\nmatters but of secondary consequence, compared with those habits of\\r\\ntruth, which are essential to the character and happiness of their\\r\\npupils? By rewarding the moral virtues more highly than the mere\\r\\ndisplay of talents, a generous emulation to excel in these virtues may\\r\\nwith certainty be excited.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany preceptors and parents will readily agree, that Bacon, in his\\r\\n\"general distribution of human knowledge,\" was perfectly right not to\\r\\nomit that branch of philosophy, which his lordship terms \"_The\\r\\ndoctrine of rising in the world_.\" To this art, integrity at length\\r\\nbecomes necessary; for talents, whether for business or for oratory,\\r\\nare now become so cheap, that they cannot alone ensure pre-eminence to\\r\\ntheir possessors.--The public opinion, which in England bestows\\r\\ncelebrity, and necessarily leads to honour, is intimately connected\\r\\nwith the public confidence. Public confidence is not the same thing as\\r\\npopularity; the one may be won, the other must be earned. There is\\r\\namongst all parties, who at present aim at political power, an\\r\\nunsatisfied demand for honest men. Those who speculate in this line\\r\\nfor their children, will do wisely to keep this fact in their\\r\\nremembrance during their whole education.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have delayed, from a full consciousness of the difficulty of the\\r\\nundertaking, to speak of the method of curing either the habits or the\\r\\npropensity to falsehood. Physicians, for mental as well as bodily\\r\\ndiseases, can give long histories of maladies; but are surprisingly\\r\\nconcise when they come to treat of the method of cure. With patients\\r\\nof different ages, and different temperaments, to speak with due\\r\\nmedical solemnity, we should advise different remedies. With young\\r\\nchildren, we should be most anxious to break the habits; with children\\r\\nat a more advanced period of their education, we should be most\\r\\ncareful to rectify the principles. Children, before they reason, act\\r\\nmerely from habit, and without having acquired command over\\r\\nthemselves, they have no power to break their own habits; but when\\r\\nyoung people reflect and deliberate, their principles are of much more\\r\\nimportance than their habits, because their principles, in fact, in\\r\\nmost cases, govern their habits. It is in consequence of their\\r\\ndeliberations and reflections that they act; and, before we can change\\r\\ntheir way of acting, we must change their way of thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo break _habits_ of falsehood in young children, let us begin by\\r\\nremoving the temptation, whatever it may be. For instance, if the\\r\\nchild has the habit of denying that he has seen, heard, or done things\\r\\nwhich he has seen, heard, and done, we must not, upon any account,\\r\\never question him about any of these particulars, but we should\\r\\nforbear to give him any pleasure which he might hope to obtain by our\\r\\nfaith in his assertions. Without entering into any explanations, we\\r\\nshould absolutely[60] disregard what he says, and with looks of cool\\r\\ncontempt, turn away without listening to his falsities. A total change\\r\\nof occupations, new objects, especially such as excite and employ the\\r\\nsenses, will be found highly advantageous. Sudden pleasure, from\\r\\nstrong expressions of affection, or eloquent praise, whenever the\\r\\nchild speaks truth, will operate powerfully in breaking his habits of\\r\\nequivocation. We do not advise parents to try sudden pain with\\r\\nchildren at this early age, neither do we advise bodily correction, or\\r\\nlasting _penitences_, meant to excite shame, because these depress and\\r\\nenfeeble the mind, and a propensity to falsehood ultimately arises\\r\\nfrom weakness and timidity. Strengthen the body and mind by all means;\\r\\ntry to give the pupils command over themselves upon occasions where\\r\\nthey have no opportunities of deceiving: the same command of mind and\\r\\ncourage, proceeding from the consciousness of strength and fortitude,\\r\\nmay, when once acquired, be exerted in any manner we direct. A boy who\\r\\ntells a falsehood to avoid some trifling pain, or to procure some\\r\\ntrifling gratification, would perhaps dare to speak the truth, if he\\r\\nwere certain that he could bear the pain, or do without the\\r\\ngratification. Without talking to him about truth or falsehood, we\\r\\nshould begin by exercising him in the art of bearing and forbearing.\\r\\nThe slightest trials are best for beginners, such as their fortitude\\r\\ncan bear, for success is necessary to increase their courage.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadame de Genlis, in her Adele and Theodore, gives Theodore,\\r\\nwhen he is about seven years old, a box of sugar-plums to take\\r\\ncare of, to teach him to command his passions. Theodore produces\\r\\nthe untouched treasure to her mother, from time to time, with great\\r\\nself-complacency. We think this a good practical lesson. Some years\\r\\nago the experiment was tried, with complete success, upon a little boy\\r\\nbetween five and six years old. This boy kept raisins and almonds in a\\r\\nlittle box in his pocket, day after day, without ever thinking of\\r\\ntouching them. His only difficulty was to remember at the appointed\\r\\ntime, at the week\\'s end, to produce them. The raisins were regularly\\r\\ncounted from time to time, and were, when found to be right, sometimes\\r\\ngiven to the child, but not always. When, for several weeks, the boy\\r\\nhad faithfully executed his trust, the time was extended for which he\\r\\nwas to keep the raisins, and every body in the family expressed that\\r\\nthey were now certain, before they counted the raisins, that they\\r\\nshould find the number exact. This confidence, which was not pretended\\r\\nconfidence, pleased the child, but the rest he considered as a matter\\r\\nof course. We think such little trials as these might be made with\\r\\nchildren of five or six years old, to give them early habits of\\r\\nexactness. The boy we have just mentioned, has grown up with a more\\r\\nunblemished reputation for truth, than any child with whom we were\\r\\never acquainted. This is the same boy who broke the looking-glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a patient, far advanced in his childhood, is yet to be cured of a\\r\\npropensity to deceive, the business becomes formidable. It is\\r\\ndangerous to set our vigilance in direct opposition to his cunning,\\r\\nand it is yet more dangerous to trust and give him opportunities of\\r\\nfresh deceit. If the pupil\\'s temper is timid, fear has probably been\\r\\nhis chief inducement to dissimulation. If his temper is sanguine, hope\\r\\nand success, and perhaps the pleasure of inventing schemes, or of\\r\\noutwitting his superiors, have been his motives. In one case we should\\r\\nprove to the patient, that he has nothing to fear from speaking the\\r\\ntruth to us; in the other case we should demonstrate to him, that he\\r\\nhas nothing to hope from telling us falsehoods. Those who are pleased\\r\\nwith the ingenuity of cunning, should have opportunities of showing\\r\\ntheir ingenuity in honourable employments, and the highest praise\\r\\nshould be given to their successful abilities whenever they are thus\\r\\nexerted. They will compare their feelings when they are the objects of\\r\\nesteem, and of contempt, and they will be led permanently to pursue\\r\\nwhat most tends to their happiness. We should never deprive them of\\r\\nthe hope of establishing a character for integrity; on the contrary,\\r\\nwe should explain distinctly to them, that this is absolutely in their\\r\\nown power. Examples from real life will strike the mind of a young\\r\\nperson just entering into the world, much more than any fictitious\\r\\ncharacters, or moral stories; and strong indignation, expressed\\r\\nincidentally, will have more effect than any lectures prepared for the\\r\\npurpose. We do not mean, that any artifice should be used to make our\\r\\nlessons impressive; but there is no artifice in seizing opportunities,\\r\\nwhich must occur in real life, to exemplify the advantages of a good\\r\\ncharacter. The opinions which young people hear expressed of actions\\r\\nin which they have no share, and of characters with whom they are not\\r\\nconnected, make a great impression upon them. The horror which is\\r\\nshown to falsehood, the shame which overwhelms the culprit, they have\\r\\nthen leisure to contemplate; they see the effects of the storm at a\\r\\ndistance; they dread to be exposed to its violence, and they will\\r\\nprepare for their own security. When any such strong impression has\\r\\nbeen made upon the mind, we should seize that moment to connect new\\r\\nprinciples with new habits of action: we should try the pupil in some\\r\\nsituation in which he has never been tried before, and where he\\r\\nconsequently may feel hope of obtaining reputation, if he deserves it,\\r\\nby integrity. All reproaches upon his former conduct should now be\\r\\nforborne, and he should be allowed to feel, in full security, the\\r\\npleasures and the honours of his new character.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot better conclude a chapter upon Truth, than by honestly\\r\\nreferring the reader to a charming piece of eloquence, with which Mr.\\r\\nGodwin concludes his essay upon Deception and Frankness.[61] We are\\r\\nsensible how much we shall lose by the comparison: we had written this\\r\\nchapter before we saw his essay.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[51] We refer to Locke\\'s Thoughts concerning Education, and Rousseau\\'s\\r\\nEmilius, vol. i.\\r\\n\\r\\n[52] V.

Let us begin with considering the nature of\\r\\npunishment, since it is best to get the most disagreeable part of our\\r\\nbusiness done the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral benevolent and enlightened authors[62] have endeavoured to\\r\\nexplain the use of penal laws, and to correct the ideas which formerly\\r\\nprevailed concerning public justice. Punishment is no longer\\r\\nconsidered, except by the ignorant and sanguinary, as vengeance from\\r\\nthe injured, or expiation from the guilty. We now distinctly\\r\\nunderstand, that the greatest possible happiness of the whole society\\r\\nmust be the ultimate object of all just legislation; that the partial\\r\\nevil of punishment is consequently to be tolerated by the wise and\\r\\nhumane legislator, only so far as it is proved to be necessary for the\\r\\ngeneral good. When a crime has been committed, it cannot be undone by\\r\\nall the art, or all the power of man; by vengeance the most\\r\\nsanguinary, or remorse the most painful. The past is irrevocable; all\\r\\nthat remains, is to provide for the future. It would be absurd, after\\r\\nan offence has already been committed, to increase the sum of misery\\r\\nin the world, by inflicting pain upon the offender, unless that pain\\r\\nwere afterwards to be productive of happiness to society, either by\\r\\npreventing the criminal from repeating his offence, or by deterring\\r\\nothers from similar enormities. With this double view of restraining\\r\\nindividuals, by the recollection of past sufferings, from future\\r\\ncrimes, and of teaching others, by public examples, to expect, and to\\r\\nfear, certain evils as the necessary consequences of certain actions\\r\\nhurtful to society, all wise laws are framed, and all just punishments\\r\\nare inflicted. It is only by the conviction that certain punishments\\r\\nare essential to the general security and happiness, that a person of\\r\\nhumanity can, or ought, to fortify his mind against the natural\\r\\nfeelings of compassion. These feelings are the most painful, and the\\r\\nmost difficult to resist, when, as it sometimes unavoidably happens,\\r\\npublic justice requires the total sacrifice of the happiness, liberty,\\r\\nor perhaps the life, of a fellow-creature, whose ignorance precluded\\r\\nhim from virtue, and whose neglected or depraved education prepared\\r\\nhim, by inevitable degrees, for vice and all its miseries. How\\r\\nexquisitely painful must be the feelings of a humane judge, in\\r\\npronouncing sentence upon such a devoted being! But the law permits of\\r\\nno refined metaphysical disquisitions. It would be vain to plead the\\r\\nnecessitarian\\'s doctrine of an unavoidable connection between the past\\r\\nand the future, in all human actions; the same necessity compels the\\r\\npunishment that compels the crime; nor could, nor ought, the most\\r\\neloquent advocate, in a court of justice, to obtain a criminal\\'s\\r\\nacquittal by entering into a minute history of the errours of his\\r\\neducation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the business of education to prevent crimes, and to prevent all\\r\\nthose habitual propensities which necessarily lead to their\\r\\ncommission. The legislator can consider only the large interests of\\r\\nsociety; the preceptor\\'s view is fixed upon the individual interests\\r\\nof his pupil. Fortunately both must ultimately agree. To secure for\\r\\nhis pupil the greatest possible quantity of happiness, taking in the\\r\\nwhole of life, must be the wish of the preceptor: this includes every\\r\\nthing. We immediately perceive the connection between that happiness,\\r\\nand obedience to all the laws on which the prosperity of society\\r\\ndepends.--We yet further perceive, that the probability of our pupil\\'s\\r\\nyielding not only an implicit, but an habitual, rational, voluntary,\\r\\nhappy obedience, to such laws, must arise from the connection which\\r\\n_he_ believes, and feels, that there exists between his social duties\\r\\nand his social happiness. How to induce this important belief, is the\\r\\nquestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is obvious, that we cannot explain to the comprehension of a child\\r\\nof three or four years old, all the truths of morality; nor can we\\r\\ndemonstrate to him the justice of punishments, by showing him that we\\r\\ngive present pain to ensure future advantage. But, though we cannot\\r\\ndemonstrate to the child that we are just, we may satisfy ourselves\\r\\nupon this subject, and we may conduct ourselves, during his non-age of\\r\\nunderstanding, with the scrupulous integrity of a guardian. Before we\\r\\ncan govern by reason, we can, by associating pain or pleasure with\\r\\ncertain actions, give habits, and these habits will be either\\r\\nbeneficial or hurtful to the pupil: we must, if they be hurtful\\r\\nhabits, conquer them by fresh punishments, and thus we make the\\r\\nhelpless child suffer for our negligence and mistakes. Formerly in\\r\\nScotland there existed a law, which obliged every farrier who, through\\r\\nignorance or drunkenness, pricked a horse\\'s foot in shoeing him, to\\r\\ndeposit the price of the horse until he was sound, to furnish the\\r\\nowner with another, and in case the horse could not be cured, the\\r\\nfarrier was doomed to indemnify the injured owner. At the same rate of\\r\\npunishment, what indemnification should be demanded from a careless or\\r\\nignorant preceptor?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a young child puts his finger too near the fire, he burns\\r\\nhimself; the pain immediately follows the action; they are associated\\r\\ntogether in the child\\'s memory; if he repeat the experiment often, and\\r\\nconstantly with the same result, the association will be so strongly\\r\\nformed, that the child will ever afterwards expect these two things to\\r\\nhappen together: whenever he puts his finger into fire, he will expect\\r\\nto feel pain; he will learn yet further, as these things regularly\\r\\nfollow one another, to think one the cause, and the other the effect.\\r\\nHe may not have words to express these ideas; nor can we explain how\\r\\nthe belief that events, which have happened together, will again\\r\\nhappen together, is by experience induced in the mind. This is a fact,\\r\\nwhich no metaphysicians pretend to dispute; but it has not yet, that\\r\\nwe know of, been accounted for by any. It would be rash to assert,\\r\\nthat it will not in future be explained, but at present we are totally\\r\\nin the dark upon the subject. It is sufficient for our purpose to\\r\\nobserve, that this association of facts, or of ideas, affects the\\r\\nactions of all rational beings, and of many animals who are called\\r\\nirrational. Would you teach a dog or a horse to obey you; do you not\\r\\nassociate pleasure, or pain, with the things you wish that they should\\r\\npractise, or avoid? The impatient and ignorant give infinitely more\\r\\npain than is necessary to the animals they educate. If the pain, which\\r\\nwe would associate with any action, do not _immediately_ follow it,\\r\\nthe child does not understand us; if several events happen nearly at\\r\\nthe same time, it is impossible that a child can at first distinguish\\r\\nwhich are causes, and which are effects. Suppose, that a mother would\\r\\nteach her little son, that he must not put his dirty shoes upon her\\r\\nclean sofa: if she frowns upon him, or speaks to him in an angry tone,\\r\\nat the instant that he sets his foot and shoe upon the sofa, he\\r\\ndesists; but he has only learned, that putting a foot upon the sofa,\\r\\nand his mother\\'s frown, follow each other; his mother\\'s frown, from\\r\\nformer associations, gives him perhaps, some pain, or the expectation\\r\\nof some pain, and consequently he avoids repeating the action which\\r\\nimmediately preceded the frown. If, a short time afterwards, the\\r\\nlittle boy, forgetting the frown, accidentally gets upon the sofa\\r\\n_without his shoes_, no evil follows; but it is not probable, that he\\r\\ncan, by this single experiment, discover that his shoes have made all\\r\\nthe difference in the two cases. Children are frequently so much\\r\\npuzzled by their confused experience of impunity and punishment, that\\r\\nthey are quite at a loss how to conduct themselves. Whenever our\\r\\npunishments are not made intelligible, they are cruel; they give pain,\\r\\nwithout producing any future advantage. To make punishment\\r\\nintelligible to children, it must be not only _immediately_, but\\r\\n_repeatedly_ and _uniformly_, associated with the actions which we\\r\\nwish them to avoid.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen children begin to reason, punishment affects them in a different\\r\\nmanner from what it did whilst they were governed, like irrational\\r\\nanimals, merely by the direct associations of pleasure and pain. They\\r\\ndistinguish, in many instances, between coincidence and causation;\\r\\nthey discover, that the will of others is the immediate cause,\\r\\nfrequently, of the pain they suffer; they learn by experience, that\\r\\nthe _will_ is not an unchangeable cause, that it is influenced by\\r\\ncircumstances, by passions, by persuasion, by caprice. It must be,\\r\\nhowever, by slow degrees, that they acquire any ideas of justice. They\\r\\ncannot know our views relative to their future happiness; their first\\r\\nideas of the justice of the punishments we inflict, cannot, therefore,\\r\\nbe accurate. They regulate these first judgments by the simple idea,\\r\\nthat our punishments ought to be exactly the same always in the same\\r\\ncircumstances; when they understand words, they learn to expect that\\r\\nour words and actions should precisely agree, that we should keep our\\r\\npromises, and _fulfil_ our threats. They next learn, that as they are\\r\\npunished for voluntary faults, they cannot justly be punished until it\\r\\nhas been distinctly explained to them what is _wrong_ or _forbidden_,\\r\\nand what is _right_ or _permitted_. The words _right_ or _wrong_,\\r\\nand _permitted_ or _forbidden_, are synonymous at first in the\\r\\napprehensions of children; and obedience and disobedience are their\\r\\nonly ideas of virtue and vice. Whatever we command to be done, or\\r\\nrather whatever we associate with pleasure, they imagine to be right;\\r\\nwhatever we prohibit, provided we have uniformly associated it with\\r\\npain, they believe to be wrong. This implicit submission to our\\r\\nauthority, and these confined ideas of right and wrong, are\\r\\nconvenient, or apparently convenient, to indolent or tyrannical\\r\\ngovernours; and they sometimes endeavour to prolong the reign of\\r\\nignorance, with the hope of establishing in the mind an opinion of\\r\\ntheir own infallibility. But this is a dangerous, as well as an\\r\\nunjust, system. By comparison with the conduct and opinions of others,\\r\\nchildren learn to judge of their parents and preceptors; by reading\\r\\nand by conversation, they acquire more enlarged notions of right and\\r\\nwrong; and their obedience, unless it then arise from the conviction\\r\\nof their understandings, depends but on a very precarious foundation.\\r\\nThe mere association of pleasure and pain, in the form of reward and\\r\\npunishment, with any given action, will not govern them; they will now\\r\\nexamine whether there is any moral or physical _necessary_ connection\\r\\nbetween the action and punishment; nor will they believe the\\r\\npunishment they suffer to be a consequence of the action they have\\r\\ncommitted, but rather a consequence of their being obliged to submit\\r\\nto the will of those who are stronger or more powerful than they are\\r\\nthemselves. Unjust punishments do not effect their intended purpose,\\r\\nbecause the pain is not associated with the action which we would\\r\\nprohibit; but, on the contrary, it is associated with the idea of our\\r\\ntyranny; it consequently excites the sentiment of hatred towards us,\\r\\ninstead of aversion to the forbidden action. When once, by reasoning,\\r\\nchildren acquire even a vague idea that those who educate them are\\r\\nunjust, it is in vain either to punish or reward them; if they submit,\\r\\nor if they rebel, their education is equally spoiled; in the one case\\r\\nthey become cowardly, in the other, headstrong. To avoid these evils,\\r\\nthere is but one method; we must early secure reason for our friend,\\r\\nelse she will become our unconquerable enemy. As soon as children are\\r\\nable, in any instance, to understand the meaning and nature of\\r\\npunishment, it should, in that instance, be explained to them. Just\\r\\npunishment is pain, inflicted with the reasonable hope of preventing\\r\\ngreater pain in future. In a family, where there are several children\\r\\neducated together, or in public schools, punishments may be inflicted\\r\\nwith justice for the sake of example, but still the reformation and\\r\\nfuture good of the sufferer is always a principal object; and of this\\r\\nhe should be made sensible. If our practice upon all occasions\\r\\ncorrespond with our theory, and if children really perceive, that we\\r\\ndo not punish them to gratify our own spleen or passion, we shall not\\r\\nbecome, even when we give them pain, objects of their hatred. The pain\\r\\nwill not be associated with us, but, as it ought to be, with the fault\\r\\nwhich was the real cause of it. As much as possible we should let\\r\\nchildren feel the natural consequences of their own conduct. The\\r\\nnatural consequence of speaking truth, is the being believed; the\\r\\nnatural consequence of falsehood, is the loss of trust and confidence;\\r\\nthe natural consequence of all the useful virtues, is esteem; of all\\r\\nthe amiable virtues, love; of each of the prudential virtues, some\\r\\npeculiar advantage to their possessor. But plum-pudding is not the\\r\\nappropriate reward of truth, nor is the loss of it the natural or\\r\\nnecessary consequence of falsehood. Prudence is not to be rewarded\\r\\nwith the affection due to humanity, nor is humanity to be recompensed\\r\\nwith the esteem claimed by prudence. Let each good and bad quality\\r\\nhave its proper share of praise and blame, and let the consequences of\\r\\neach follow as constantly as possible. That young people may form a\\r\\nsteady judgment of the danger of any vice, they must uniformly\\r\\nperceive, that certain painful consequences result from its practice.\\r\\nIt is in vain that we inflict punishments, unless all the precepts and\\r\\nall the examples which they see, confirm them in the same belief.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the unfortunate son of Peter the Great, we have a striking instance\\r\\nof the effects of a disagreement between precept and example,[63]\\r\\nwhich, in a less elevated situation, might have escaped our notice. It\\r\\nseems as if the different parts and stages of his education had been\\r\\npurposely contrived to counteract each other. Till he was eleven years\\r\\nold, he was committed to the care of women, and of ignorant bigotted\\r\\npriests, who were continually inveighing against his father for the\\r\\nabolition of certain barbarous customs. Then came baron Huysen for his\\r\\ngovernour, a sensible man, who had just begun to make something of his\\r\\npupil, when prince Menzikof insisted upon having the sole management\\r\\nof the unfortunate Alexey. Prince Menzikof abandoned him to the\\r\\ncompany of the lowest wretches, who encouraged him in continual\\r\\nebriety, and in a taste for every thing mean and profligate. At length\\r\\ncame Euphrosyne, his Finlandish mistress, who, upon his trial for\\r\\nrebellion, deposed to every angry expression which, in his most\\r\\nunguarded moments, the wretched son had uttered against the tyrannical\\r\\nfather. Amidst such scenes of contradictory experience, can we be\\r\\nsurprised, that Alexey Petrovitch became feeble, ignorant, and\\r\\nprofligate; that he rebelled against the father whom he had early been\\r\\ntaught to fear and hate; that he listened to the pernicious counsels\\r\\nof the companions who had, by pretended sympathy and flattery,\\r\\nobtained that place in his confidence which no parental kindness had\\r\\never secured? Those historians who are zealous for the glory of Peter\\r\\nthe Great, have eagerly refuted, as a most atrocious calumny, the\\r\\nreport of his having had any part in the mysterious death of his son.\\r\\nBut how will they apologize for the Czar\\'s neglect of that son\\'s\\r\\neducation, from which all the misfortunes of his life arose?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all this is past for ever; the only advantage we can gain from\\r\\nrecalling these circumstances, is a confirmation of this important\\r\\nprinciple in education; that, when precept and example counteract one\\r\\nanother, there is no hope of success. Nor can the utmost severity\\r\\neffect any useful purpose, whilst the daily experience of the pupil\\r\\ncontradicts his preceptor\\'s lessons. In fact, severity is seldom\\r\\nnecessary in a well conducted education. The smallest possible degree\\r\\nof pain, which can, in any case, produce the required effect, is\\r\\nindisputably the just measure of the punishment which ought to be\\r\\ninflicted in any given case. This simple axiom will lead us to a\\r\\nnumber of truths, which immediately depend upon, or result from it. We\\r\\nmust attend to every circumstance which can diminish the quantity of\\r\\npain, without lessening the efficacy of punishment. Now it has been\\r\\nfound from experience, that there are several circumstances which\\r\\noperate uniformly to this purpose. We formerly observed, that the\\r\\neffect of punishment upon the minds of children, before they reason,\\r\\ndepends much upon its _immediately_ succeeding the fault, and also\\r\\nupon its being certainly repeated whenever the same fault is\\r\\ncommitted. After children acquire the power of reasoning, from a\\r\\nvariety of new motives, these laws, with respect to punishment, derive\\r\\nadditional force. A trifling degree of pain will answer the purpose,\\r\\nif it be made inevitable; whilst the fear of an enormous proportion of\\r\\nuncertain punishment, will not be found sufficient to govern the\\r\\nimagination. The contemplation of a distant punishment, however\\r\\nsevere, does not affect the imagination with much terror, because\\r\\nthere is still a secret hope of escape in the mind. Hence it is found\\r\\nfrom experience, that the most sanguinary penal laws have always been\\r\\nineffectual to restrain from crimes.[64] Even if detection be\\r\\ninevitable, and consequent punishment equally inevitable, if\\r\\npunishment be not inflicted as soon as the criminal is convicted, it\\r\\nhas been found that it has not, either as a preventative, or a public\\r\\nexample, the same power upon the human mind. Not only should the\\r\\npunishment be immediate after conviction, but detection should follow\\r\\nthe offence as speedily as possible. Without entering at large into\\r\\nthe intricate arguments concerning identity and consciousness, we may\\r\\nobserve, that the consciousness of having committed the offence for\\r\\nwhich he suffers, ought, at the time of suffering, to be strong in the\\r\\noffender\\'s mind. Though proofs of his identity may have been legally\\r\\nestablished in a court of justice; and though, as far as it relates to\\r\\npublic justice, it matters not whether the offence for which he is\\r\\npunished has been committed yesterday or a year ago; yet, as to the\\r\\neffect which the punishment produces on the culprit\\'s own mind, there\\r\\nmust be a material difference.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I desire you to judge of me, not by what I was, but by what I am,\"\\r\\nsaid a philosopher, when he was reproached for some of his past\\r\\ntransgressions. If the interval between an offence and its punishment\\r\\nbe long, it is possible that, during this interval, a complete change\\r\\nmay be made in the views and habits of the offender; such a change as\\r\\nshall absolutely preclude all probability of his repeating his\\r\\noffence. His punishment must then be purely for the sake of example to\\r\\nothers. He suffers pain at the time, perhaps, when he is in the best\\r\\nsocial dispositions possible; and thus we punish the present good man\\r\\nfor the faults of the former offender. We readily excuse the violence\\r\\nwhich a man in a passion may have committed, when, upon his return to\\r\\nhis sober senses, he expresses contrition and surprise at his own\\r\\nexcesses; he assures us, and we believe him, that he is now a\\r\\nperfectly different person. If we do not feel any material ill\\r\\nconsequences from his late anger, we are willing, and even desirous,\\r\\nthat the passionate man should not, in his sober state, be punished\\r\\nfor his madness; all that we can desire, is to have some security\\r\\nagainst his falling into any fresh fit of anger. Could his habits of\\r\\ntemper be instantly changed, and could we have a moral certainty that\\r\\nhis frenzy would never more do us any injury, would it not be\\r\\nmalevolent and unjust to punish him for his old insanity? If we think\\r\\nand act upon these principles with respect to men, how much more\\r\\nindulgent should we be to children? Indulgence is perhaps an improper\\r\\nword--but in other words, how careful should we be never to chain\\r\\nchildren to their dead faults![65] Children, during their education,\\r\\nmust be in a continual state of progression; they are not the same\\r\\nto-day that they were yesterday; they have little reflection; their\\r\\nconsciousness of the present occupies them; and it would be extremely\\r\\ndifficult from day to day, or from hour to hour, to identify their\\r\\nminds. Far from wishing that they should distinctly remember all their\\r\\npast thoughts, and that they should value themselves upon their\\r\\ncontinuing the same, we must frequently desire that they should forget\\r\\ntheir former errours, and absolutely change their manner of thinking.\\r\\nThey should feel no interest in adhering to former bad habits or false\\r\\nopinions; therefore, their pride should not be roused to defend these\\r\\nby our making them a part of their standing character. The character\\r\\nof children is _to be_ formed--we should never speak of it as\\r\\npositively fixed. Man has been defined to be a bundle of habits; till\\r\\nthe bundle is made up, we may continually increase or diminish it.\\r\\nChildren who are zealous in defence of their own perfections, are of\\r\\nall others most likely to become stationary in their intellectual\\r\\nprogress, and disingenuous in their temper. It would be in vain to\\r\\nrepeat to them this sensible and elegant observation--\"To confess that\\r\\nyou have been in the wrong, is only saying, in other words, that you\\r\\nare wiser to-day than you were yesterday.\" This remark will rather\\r\\npique, than comfort, the pride of those who are anxious to prove that\\r\\nthey have been equally wise and immaculate in every day of their\\r\\nexistence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be said, that children cannot too early be made sensible of the\\r\\nvalue of reputation, and they must be taught to connect the ideas of\\r\\ntheir past and present _selves_, otherwise they cannot perceive, for\\r\\ninstance, why confidence should be placed in them in proportion to\\r\\ntheir past integrity; or why falsehood should lead to distrust. The\\r\\nforce of this argument must be admitted; yet still we must consider\\r\\nthe age and strength of mind in children in applying it to practice.\\r\\nTruth is not instinctive in the mind, and the ideas of integrity, and\\r\\nof the advantages of reputation, must be very cautiously introduced,\\r\\nlest, by giving children too perfect a theory of morality, before they\\r\\nhave sufficient strength of mind to adhere to it in practice, we may\\r\\nmake them hypocrites, or else give them a fatal distrust of\\r\\nthemselves, founded upon too early an experience of their own\\r\\nweakness, and too great sensibility to shame.\\r\\n\\r\\nShame, when it once becomes familiar to the mind, loses its effect; it\\r\\nshould not, therefore, be used as a common punishment for slight\\r\\nfaults. Nor should we trust very early in education to the delicate\\r\\nsecret influence of conscience; but we should take every precaution to\\r\\nprevent the necessity of having recourse to the punishment of\\r\\ndisgrace; and we must, if we mean to preserve the power of conscience,\\r\\ntake care that it be never disregarded with impunity. We must avoid\\r\\nopposing it to strong temptation; nor should we ever try the integrity\\r\\nof children, except in situations where we can be perfectly certain of\\r\\nthe result of the experiment. We must neither run the risk of\\r\\ninjuring them by unjust suspicions, nor unmerited confidence. By\\r\\nprudent arrangements, and by unremitted daily attention, we should\\r\\nabsolutely prevent the possibility of deceit. By giving few commands,\\r\\nor prohibitions, we may avoid the danger of either secret or open\\r\\ndisobedience. By diminishing temptations to do wrong, we act more\\r\\nhumanely than by multiplying restraints and punishments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been found, that no restraints or punishments have proved\\r\\nadequate to ensure obedience to laws, whenever strong temptations, and\\r\\nmany probabilities of evasion, combine in opposition to conscience or\\r\\nfear. The terrors of the law have been for years ineffectually\\r\\ndirected against a race of beings called smugglers: yet smuggling is\\r\\nstill an extensive, lucrative, and not universally discreditable,\\r\\nprofession. Let any person look into the history of the excise\\r\\nlaws,[66] and he will be astonished at the accumulation of penal\\r\\nstatutes, which the active, but ineffectual, ingenuity of prohibitory\\r\\nlegislators has devised in the course of about thirty years. Open war\\r\\nwas declared against all illegal distillers; yet the temptation to\\r\\nillegal distilling continually increased, in proportion to the heavy\\r\\nduties laid upon the fair trader. It came at length to a trial of\\r\\nskill between revenue officers and distillers, which could cheat, or\\r\\nwhich could detect, the fastest. The distiller had the strongest\\r\\ninterest in the business, and he usually came off victorious.\\r\\n_Coursing officers_, and _watching officers_ (once ten _watching\\r\\nofficers_ were set upon one distiller) and _surveyors_ and\\r\\n_supervisors_, multiplied without end: the land in their fiscal maps\\r\\nwas portioned out into _divisions_ and _districts_, and each gauger\\r\\nhad the charge of all the distillers in his division: the watching\\r\\nofficer went first, and the coursing officer went after him, and after\\r\\nhim the supervisor; and they had _table-books_, and _gauging-rods_,\\r\\nand _dockets_, and _permits_; permits for sellers, and permits for\\r\\nbuyers, and permits for foreign spirits, printed in red ink, and\\r\\npermits for British spirits, in black ink; and they went about night\\r\\nand day with their hydrometers, to ascertain the strength of spirits;\\r\\nand with their gauging-rods, to measure _wash_. But the pertinacious\\r\\ndistiller was still flourishing; permits were forged; concealed pipes\\r\\nwere fabricated; and the proportion between the _wash_ and _spirits_\\r\\nwas seldom legal. The commisioners complained, and the legislators\\r\\nwent to work again. Under a penalty of one hundred pounds, distillers\\r\\nwere ordered to paint the words _distiller, dealer in spirits_, over\\r\\ntheir doors; and it was further enacted, that all the distillers\\r\\nshould furnish, at their own expense, any kind of locks, and\\r\\nfastenings, which the revenue officers should require for locking up\\r\\nthe doors of their own furnaces, the heads of their own stills, pumps,\\r\\npipes, &c. First, suspicions fell upon the public distiller for\\r\\nexportation; then his utensils were locked up; afterwards the private\\r\\ndistiller was suspected, and he was locked up: then they set him and\\r\\nhis furnaces at liberty, and went back in a passion to the public\\r\\ndistiller. The legislature condescended to interfere, and with a new\\r\\nlock and key, precisely described in an act of parliament, it was\\r\\nhoped all would be made secure. Any person being a distiller, who\\r\\nshould lock up his furnace or pipes with a key constructed differently\\r\\nfrom that which the act described, or any person making such illegal\\r\\nkey for said distiller, was subject to the forfeiture of one hundred\\r\\npounds. The padlock was never fixed upon the mind, and even the lock\\r\\nand key, prescribed by act of parliament, were found inefficacious.\\r\\nAny common blacksmith, with a picklock in his possession, laughed at\\r\\nthe combined skill of the two houses of parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis digression from the rewards and punishments of children, to the\\r\\ndistillery laws, may, it is hoped, be pardoned, if the useful moral\\r\\ncan be drawn from it, that, where there are great temptations to\\r\\nfraud, and continual opportunities of evasion, no laws, however\\r\\ningenious, no punishments, however exorbitant, can avail. The history\\r\\nof coiners, venders, and utterers, of his majesty\\'s coin, as lately\\r\\ndetailed to us by respectable authority,[67] may afford further\\r\\nillustration of this principle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no imminent danger of children\\'s becoming either coiners or\\r\\nfraudulent distillers; but an ingenious preceptor will not be much\\r\\npuzzled in applying the remarks that have been made, to the subject of\\r\\neducation. For the anticlimax, in descending from the legislation of\\r\\nmen to the government of children, no apology is attempted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fewer the laws we make for children, the better. Whatever they may\\r\\nbe, they should be distinctly expressed; the letter and spirit should\\r\\nboth agree, and the words should bear but one signification, clear to\\r\\nall the parties concerned. They should never be subject to the ex post\\r\\nfacto interpretation of an angry preceptor, or a cunning pupil; no\\r\\nloose general terms should permit tyranny, or encourage quibbling.\\r\\nThere is said[68] to be a Chinese law, which decrees, that whoever\\r\\ndoes not show _proper respect_ to the sovereign, is to be punished\\r\\nwith death. What is meant by the words _proper respect_, is not\\r\\ndefined. Two persons made a mistake in some account of an\\r\\ninsignificant affair, in one of their court gazettes. It was declared,\\r\\nthat _to lie_ in a court gazette, is to be wanting in _proper respect_\\r\\nto the court. Both the careless scribes were put to death. One of the\\r\\nprinces of the blood inadvertently put some mark upon a memorial,\\r\\nwhich had been signed by the emperor Bogdo Chan. This was construed to\\r\\nbe a want of _proper respect_ to Bogdo Chan the emperor, and a\\r\\nhorrible persecution hence arose against the scrawling prince and his\\r\\nwhole family. May no schoolmasters, ushers, or others, ever (even as\\r\\nfar as they are able) imitate Bogdo Chan, and may they always define\\r\\nto their subjects, what they mean by _proper respect_!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a sort of mistaken mercy sometimes shown to children, which\\r\\nis, in reality, the greatest cruelty. People, who are too angry to\\r\\nrefrain from threats, are often too indolent, or too compassionate, to\\r\\nput their threats in execution. Between their words and actions there\\r\\nis hence a manifest contradiction; their pupils learn from experience,\\r\\neither totally to disregard these threats, or else to calculate, from\\r\\nthe various degrees of anger which appear in the threatener\\'s\\r\\ncountenance, what real probability there is of his being as good or as\\r\\nbad as his word. Far from perceiving that punishment, in this case, is\\r\\n_pain given with the reasonable hope of making him wiser or happier_,\\r\\nthe pupil is convinced, that his master punishes him only to gratify\\r\\nthe passion of anger, to which he is unfortunately subject. Even\\r\\nsupposing that threateners are exact in fulfilling their threats, and\\r\\nthat they are not passionate, but simply wish to avoid giving pain;\\r\\nthey endeavour to excite the fears of their pupils as the means of\\r\\ngoverning them with the least possible pain. But with fear they excite\\r\\nall the passions and habits which are connected with that mean\\r\\nprinciple of action, and they extinguish that vigorous spirit, that\\r\\nindependent energy of soul, which is essential to all the active and\\r\\nmanly virtues. Young people, who find that their daily pleasures\\r\\ndepend not so much upon their own exertions as upon the humour and\\r\\ncaprice of others, become absolute courtiers; they practise all the\\r\\narts of persuasion, and all the crouching hypocrisy which can\\r\\ndeprecate wrath, or propitiate favour. Their notions of right and\\r\\nwrong cannot be enlarged; their recollection of the rewards and\\r\\npunishments of their childhood, is always connected with the ideas of\\r\\ntyranny and slavery; and when they break their own chains, they are\\r\\nimpatient to impose similar bonds upon their inferiors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn argument has been used to prove, that in some cases anger is part\\r\\nof the _justice_ of punishment, because \"mere _reproof_, without\\r\\nsufficient marks of _displeasure_ and _emotion_, affects a child very\\r\\nlittle, and is soon forgotten.\"[69] It cannot be doubted, that the\\r\\nexpression of indignation is a just consequence of certain faults, and\\r\\nthe general indignation with which these are spoken of before young\\r\\npeople, must make a strong and useful impression upon their minds.\\r\\nThey reflect upon the actions of others; they see the effects which\\r\\nthese produce upon the human mind; they put themselves in the\\r\\nsituation alternately of the person who expresses indignation, and of\\r\\nhim who suffers shame; they measure the fault and its consequences,\\r\\nand they resolve to conduct themselves so as to avoid that just\\r\\nindignation of which they dread to be the object. These are the\\r\\ngeneral conclusions which children draw when they are _impartial\\r\\nspectators_; but where they are themselves concerned, their feelings\\r\\nand their reasonings are very different. If they have done any thing\\r\\nwhich they know to be wrong, they expect, and are sensible that they\\r\\ndeserve, displeasure and indignation; but if any precise penalty is\\r\\nannexed to the fault, the person who is to inflict it, appears to them\\r\\nin the character of a judge, who is bound to repress his own feelings,\\r\\nand coolly to execute justice. If the judge both reproaches and\\r\\npunishes, he doubles the punishment. Whenever indignation is\\r\\nexpressed, no vulgar trivial penalties should accompany it; the pupil\\r\\nshould feel that it is indignation against his fault, and not against\\r\\nhimself; and that it is not excited in his preceptor\\'s mind by any\\r\\npetty personal considerations. A child distinguishes between anger and\\r\\nindignation very exactly; the one commands his respect, the other\\r\\nraises his contempt as soon as his fears subside. Dr. Priestley seems\\r\\nto think that, \"it is not possible to express displeasure with\\r\\nsufficient _force_, especially to a child, when a man is perfectly\\r\\ncool.\" May we not reply to this, that it is scarcely possible to\\r\\nexpress displeasure with sufficient _propriety_, especially to a\\r\\nchild, when a man is in a passion? The propriety is, in this case, of\\r\\nat least as much consequence as the force of the reprimand.--The\\r\\neffect which the preceptor\\'s displeasure will produce, must be, in\\r\\nsome proportion, to the esteem which his pupil feels for him. If he\\r\\ncannot command his irascible passions, his pupil cannot continue to\\r\\nesteem him; and there is an end of all that fear of his\\r\\ndisapprobation, which was founded upon esteem, and which can never be\\r\\nfounded upon a stronger or a better basis. We should further consider,\\r\\nthat the opinions of all the bystanders, especially if they be any of\\r\\nthem of the pupil\\'s own age, have great influence upon his mind. It is\\r\\nnot to be expected that they should all sympathize equally with the\\r\\nangry preceptor; and we know, that whenever the indignation expressed\\r\\nagainst any fault, appears, in the least, to pass the bound of exact\\r\\njustice, the sympathy of the spectators immediately revolts in favour\\r\\nof the culprit; the fault is forgotten or excused, and all join in\\r\\nspontaneous compassion. In public schools, this happens so frequently,\\r\\nthat the master\\'s displeasure seldom affects the little community with\\r\\nany sorrow; combined together, they make each other amends for public\\r\\npunishments, by private pity or encouragement. In families, which are\\r\\nnot well regulated, that is to say, in which the interests of all the\\r\\nindividuals do not coalesce, the same evils are to be dreaded. Neither\\r\\nindignation nor _shame_ can affect children in such schools, or such\\r\\nfamilies; the laws and manners, public precept and private opinion,\\r\\ncontradict one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a variety of instances in society, we may observe, that the best\\r\\nlaws and the best principles are not sufficient to resist the\\r\\ncombination of numbers. Never attempt to affix infamy to a number of\\r\\npeople at once, says a philosophic legislator.[70] This advice showed\\r\\nthat he perfectly understood the nature of the passion of shame.\\r\\nNumbers keep one another in countenance; they form a society for\\r\\nthemselves; and sometimes by peculiar phrases, and an appropriate\\r\\nlanguage, confound the established opinions of virtue and vice, and\\r\\nenjoy a species of self-complacency independent of public opinion, and\\r\\noften in direct opposition to their former _conscience_. Whenever any\\r\\nset of men want to get rid of the shame annexed to particular actions,\\r\\nthey begin by changing the names and epithets which have been\\r\\ngenerally used to express them, and which they know are associated\\r\\nwith the feelings of shame: these feelings are not awakened by the new\\r\\nlanguage, and by degrees they are forgotten, or they are supposed to\\r\\nhave been merely prejudices and habits, which _former methods of\\r\\nspeaking_ taught people to reverence. Thus the most disgraceful\\r\\ncombinations of men, who live by violating and evading the laws of\\r\\nsociety, have all a peculiar phraseology amongst themselves, by which\\r\\njocular ideas are associated with the most disreputable actions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who live by depredation on the river Thames, do not call\\r\\nthemselves thieves, but _lumpers_ and _mudlarks_. Coiners give regular\\r\\nmercantile names to the different branches of their trade, and to the\\r\\nvarious kinds of false money which they circulate: such as _flats_, or\\r\\n_figs_, or _fig-things_. Unlicensed lottery wheels, are called _little\\r\\ngoes_; and the men who are sent about to public houses to entice poor\\r\\npeople into illegal lottery insurances, are called _Morocco-men_: a\\r\\nset of villains, hired by these fraudulent lottery keepers, to resist\\r\\nthe civil power during the drawing of the lottery, call themselves\\r\\n_bludgeon-men_; and in the language of robbers, a receiver of stolen\\r\\ngoods is said to be _staunch_, when it is believed that he will go all\\r\\nlengths rather than betray the secrets of a gang of highwaymen.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince words have such power in their turn over ideas, we must, in\\r\\neducation, attend to the language of children as a means of judging\\r\\nof the state of their minds; and whenever we find, that in their\\r\\nconversation with one another, they have any slang, which turns moral\\r\\nideas into ridicule, we may be certain that this must have arisen from\\r\\nsome defect in their education. The power of shame must then be tried\\r\\nin some new shape, to break this false association of ideas. Shame, in\\r\\na new shape, affects the mind with surprising force, in the same\\r\\nmanner as danger in a new form alarms the courage of veterans. An\\r\\nextraordinary instance of this, may be observed in the management of\\r\\nGloucester jail: a blue and yellow jacket has been found to have a\\r\\nmost powerful effect upon men supposed to be dead to shame. The keeper\\r\\nof the prison told us, that the most unruly offenders could be kept in\\r\\nawe by the dread of a dress which exposed them to the ridicule of\\r\\ntheir companions, no new term having been yet invented to counteract\\r\\nthe terrors of the yellow jacket. To prevent the mind from becoming\\r\\ninsensible to shame, it must be very sparingly used; and the hope and\\r\\npossibility of recovering esteem, must always be kept alive. Those who\\r\\nare excluded from hope, are necessarily excluded from virtue; the loss\\r\\nof reputation, we see, is almost always followed by total depravity.\\r\\nThe cruel prejudices which are harboured against particular classes of\\r\\npeople, usually tend to make the individuals who are the best disposed\\r\\namongst these sects, despair of obtaining esteem; and, consequently,\\r\\ncareless about deserving it. There can be nothing inherent in the\\r\\nknavish propensity of Jews; but the prevailing opinion, that avarice,\\r\\ndishonesty and extortion, are the characteristics of a Jew, has\\r\\nprobably induced many of the tribe to justify the antipathy which they\\r\\ncould not conquer. Children are frequently confirmed in faults, by the\\r\\nimprudent and cruel custom which some parents have of settling early\\r\\nin life, that such a thing is natural; that such and such dispositions\\r\\nare not to be cured; that cunning, perhaps, is the characteristic of\\r\\none child, and caprice of another. This general odium oppresses and\\r\\ndispirits: such children think it is in vain to struggle against\\r\\nnature, especially as they do not clearly understand what is meant by\\r\\nnature. They submit to our imputations, without knowing how to refute\\r\\nthem. On the contrary, if we treat them with more good sense and\\r\\nbenevolence, if we explain to them the nature of the human mind, and\\r\\nif we lay open to them the history of their own, they will assist us\\r\\nin endeavouring to cure their faults, and they will not be debilitated\\r\\nby indistinct, superstitious fears. At ten or eleven years old,\\r\\nchildren are capable of understanding some of the general principles\\r\\nof rational morality, and these they can apply to their own conduct in\\r\\nmany instances, which, however trivial they may appear, are not\\r\\nbeneath our notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 16, 1796. S---- (nine years old) had lost his pencil; his father\\r\\nsaid to him, \"I wish to give you another pencil, but I am afraid I\\r\\nshould do you harm if I did; you would not take care of your things if\\r\\nyou did not feel some inconvenience when you lose them.\" The boy\\'s\\r\\nlips moved as if he were saying to himself, \"I understand this; it is\\r\\njust.\" His father guessed that these were the thoughts that were\\r\\npassing in his mind, and asked whether he interpreted rightly the\\r\\nmotion of the lips. \"Yes,\" said S----, \"that was exactly what I was\\r\\nthinking.\" \"Then,\" said his father, \"I will give you a bit of my own\\r\\npencil this instant: all I want is to make the necessary impression\\r\\nupon your mind; that is all the use of punishment; you know we do not\\r\\nwant to torment you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs young people grow up, and perceive the consequences of their own\\r\\nactions, and the advantages of credit and character, they become\\r\\nextremely solicitous to preserve the good opinion of those whom they\\r\\nlove and esteem. They are now capable of taking the future into their\\r\\nview as well as the present; and at this period of their education,\\r\\nthe hand of authority should never be hastily used; the voice of\\r\\nreason will never fail to make herself heard, especially if reason\\r\\nspeak with the tone of affection. During the first years of childhood,\\r\\nit did not seem prudent to make any punishment lasting, because young\\r\\nchildren quickly forget their faults; and having little experience,\\r\\ncannot feel how their past conduct is likely to affect their future\\r\\nhappiness: but as soon as they have more enlarged experience, the\\r\\nnature of their punishments should alter; if we have any reason to\\r\\nesteem or love them less, our contempt and displeasure should not\\r\\nlightly be dissipated. Those who reflect, are more influenced by the\\r\\nidea of the duration, than of the intensity of any mental pain. In\\r\\nthose calculations which are constantly made before we determine upon\\r\\naction or forbearance, some tempers estimate any evil which is likely\\r\\nto be but of short duration, infinitely below its real importance.\\r\\nYoung men, of sanguine and courageous dispositions, hence frequently\\r\\nact imprudently; the consequences of their temerity will, they think,\\r\\nsoon be over, and they feel that they are able to support evil for a\\r\\nshort time, however great it may be. Anger, they know, is a\\r\\nshort-lived passion, and they do not scruple running the hazard of\\r\\nexciting anger in the hearts of those they love the best in the world.\\r\\nThe experience of lasting, sober disapprobation, is intolerably\\r\\nirksome to them; any inconvenience which continues for a length of\\r\\ntime, wearies them excessively. After they have endured, as the\\r\\nconsequence of any actions, this species of punishment, they will long\\r\\nremember their sufferings, and will carefully avoid incurring, in\\r\\nfuture, similar penalties. Sudden and transient pain appears to be\\r\\nmost effectual with persons of an opposite temperament.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung people, of a torpid, indolent temperament, are much under the\\r\\ndominion of habit; if they happen to have contracted any disagreeable\\r\\nor bad habits, they have seldom sufficient energy to break them. The\\r\\nstimulus of sudden pain is necessary in this case. The pupil may be\\r\\nperfectly convinced, that such a habit ought to be broken, and may\\r\\nwish to break it most sincerely; but may yet be incapable of the\\r\\nvoluntary exertion requisite to obtain success. It would be dangerous\\r\\nto let the habit, however insignificant, continue victorious, because\\r\\nthe child would hence be discouraged from all future attempts to\\r\\nbattle with himself. Either we should not attempt the conquest of the\\r\\nhabit, or we should persist till we have vanquished. The confidence,\\r\\nwhich this sense of success will give the pupil, will probably, in his\\r\\nown opinion, be thought well worthy the price. Neither his reason nor\\r\\nhis will was in fault; all he wanted, was strength to break the\\r\\ndiminutive chains of habit; chains which, it seems, have power to\\r\\nenfeeble their captives exactly in proportion to the length of time\\r\\nthey are worn.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery body has probably found, from their own experience, how\\r\\ndifficult it is to alter little habits in manners, pronunciation, &c.\\r\\nChildren are often teased with frequent admonitions about their habits\\r\\nof sitting, standing, walking, talking, eating, speaking, &c. Parents\\r\\nare early aware of the importance of agreeable, graceful manners;\\r\\nevery body who sees children, can judge, or think that they can judge,\\r\\nof their manners; and from anxiety that children should appear to\\r\\nadvantage in company, parents solicitously watch all their gestures,\\r\\nand correct all their attitudes according to that image of the \"_beau\\r\\nideal_,\" which happens to be most fashionable. The most convenient and\\r\\nnatural attitudes are not always the most approved. The constraint\\r\\nwhich children suffer from their obedience, obliges them at length to\\r\\nrest their tortured muscles, and to throw themselves, for relief, into\\r\\nattitudes the very reverse of those which they have practised with so\\r\\nmuch pain. Hence they acquire opposite habits in their manners, and\\r\\nthere is a continual struggle between these. They find it impossible\\r\\nto correct, instantaneously, the awkward tricks which they have\\r\\nacquired, and they learn _ineffectually_ to attempt a conquest over\\r\\nthemselves; or else, which is most commonly the catastrophe, they\\r\\nlearn to hear the exhortations and rebukes of all around them, without\\r\\nbeing stimulated to any degree of exertion.[72] The same voices which\\r\\nlose their power on these trifling occasions, lose, at the same time,\\r\\nmuch of their general influence. More _power_ is wasted upon trifling\\r\\ndefects in the manners of children, than can be imagined by any who\\r\\nhave not particularly attended to this subject. If it be thought\\r\\nindispensably necessary to speak to children eternally about their\\r\\nmanners, this irritating and disagreeable office should devolve upon\\r\\nsomebody whose influence over the children we are not anxious to\\r\\npreserve undiminished. A little ingenuity in contriving the dress,\\r\\nwriting desks, reading desks, &c. of children, who are any way\\r\\ndefective in their shape, might spare much of the anxiety which is\\r\\nfelt by their parents, and much of the bodily and mental pain which\\r\\nthey alternately endure themselves. For these patients, would it not\\r\\nbe rather more safe to consult the philosophic physician,[73] than the\\r\\ndancing master who is not bound to understand either anatomy or\\r\\nmetaphysics?\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery preventative which is discovered for any defect, either in\\r\\nmanners, temper, or understanding, diminishes the necessity for\\r\\npunishment. Punishments are _the abrupt, brutal resource of ignorance,\\r\\nfrequently_,[74] to cure the effects of former negligence. With\\r\\nchildren who have been reasonably and affectionately educated,\\r\\nscarcely any punishments are requisite. This is not an assertion\\r\\nhazarded without experience; the happy experience of several years,\\r\\nand of several children of different ages and tempers, justifies this\\r\\nassertion. As for corporeal punishments, they may be necessary where\\r\\nboys are to be _drilled_ in a given time into scholars; but the\\r\\nlanguage of blows need seldom be used to reasonable creatures. The\\r\\nidea that it is disgraceful to be governed by force, should be kept\\r\\nalive in the minds of children; the dread of shame is a more powerful\\r\\nmotive than the fear of bodily pain. To prove the truth of this, we\\r\\nmay recollect that few people have ever been known to destroy\\r\\nthemselves in order to escape from bodily pain; but numbers, to avoid\\r\\nshame, have put an end to their existence. It has been a question,\\r\\nwhether mankind are most governed by hope or by fear, by rewards or by\\r\\npunishments? This question, like many others which have occasioned\\r\\ntedious debates, turns chiefly upon words. Hope and fear are sometimes\\r\\nused to denote mixed, and sometimes unmixed, passions. Those who speak\\r\\nof them as unmixed passions, cannot have accurately examined their own\\r\\nfeelings.[75] The probability of good, produces hope; the probability\\r\\nof evil, excites fear; and as this probability appears less or\\r\\ngreater, more remote or nearer to us, the mind fluctuates between the\\r\\nopposite passions. When the probability increases on either side, so\\r\\ndoes the corresponding passion. Since these passions seldom exist in\\r\\nabsolute separation from one another, it appears that we cannot\\r\\nphilosophically speak of either as an independent motive: to the\\r\\nquestion, therefore, \"which governs mankind the most, hope or fear?\"\\r\\nwe cannot give an explicit answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we would determine upon the probability of any good or evil, we\\r\\nare insensibly influenced, not only by the view of the circumstances\\r\\nbefore us, but also by our previous habits; we judge not only by the\\r\\ngeneral laws of human events, but also by our own individual\\r\\nexperience. If we have been usually successful, we are inclined to\\r\\nhope; have we been accustomed to misfortunes, we are hence disposed to\\r\\nfear. \"C\\xc3\\xa6sar and his fortune are on board,\" exclaimed the confident\\r\\nhero to the mariners. Hope excites the mind to exertion; fear\\r\\nrepresses all activity. As a preventative from vice, you may employ\\r\\nfear; to restrain the excesses of all the furious passions, it is\\r\\nuseful and necessary: but would you rouse the energies of virtue, you\\r\\nmust inspire and invigorate the soul with hope. Courage, generosity,\\r\\nindustry, perseverance, all the magic of talents, all the powers of\\r\\ngenius, all the virtues that appear spontaneous in great minds, spring\\r\\nfrom hope. But how different is the hope of a great and of a little\\r\\nmind; not only are the objects of this hope different, but the passion\\r\\nitself is raised and supported in a different manner. A feeble person,\\r\\nif he presumes to hope, hopes as superstitiously as he fears; he keeps\\r\\nhis attention sedulously fixed upon all the probabilities in his\\r\\nfavour; he will not listen to any arguments in opposition to his\\r\\nwishes; he knows he is unreasonable, he persists in continuing so; he\\r\\ndoes not connect any idea of exertion with hope; his hope usually\\r\\nrests upon the exertions of others, or upon some fortuitous\\r\\ncircumstances. A man of a strong mind, reasons before he hopes; he\\r\\ntakes in, at one quick, comprehensive glance, all that is to be seen\\r\\nboth for and against him; he is, from experience, disposed to depend\\r\\nmuch upon his own exertions, if they can turn the balance in his\\r\\nfavour; he hopes, he acts, he succeeds. Poets, in all ages, have\\r\\ncelebrated the charms of hope; without her propitious influence, life,\\r\\nthey tell us, would be worse than death; without her smiles, nature\\r\\nwould smile in vain; without her promises, treacherous though they\\r\\noften prove, reality would have nothing to give worthy of our\\r\\nacceptance. We are not bound, however, to understand literally, the\\r\\nrhetoric of poets. Hope is to them a beautiful and useful allegorical\\r\\npersonage: sometimes leaning upon an anchor; sometimes \"waving her\\r\\ngolden hair;\" always young, smiling, enchanting, furnished with a rich\\r\\nassortment of epithets suited to the ode, the sonnet, the madrigal,\\r\\nwith a traditionary number of images and allusions; what more can a\\r\\npoet desire? Men, except when they are poets, do not value hope as the\\r\\nfirst of terrestrial blessings. The action and energies which hope\\r\\nproduces, are to many more agreeable than the passion itself; that\\r\\nfeverish state of suspense, which prevents settled thought or vigorous\\r\\nexertion, far from being agreeable, is highly painful to a well\\r\\nregulated mind; the continued repetition of the same ideas and the\\r\\nsame calculations, fatigues the mind, which, in reasoning, has been\\r\\naccustomed to arrive at some certain conclusion, or to advance, at\\r\\nleast, a step at every effort. The exercise of the mind, in changing\\r\\nthe views of its object, which is supposed to be a great part of the\\r\\npleasure of hope, is soon over to an active imagination, which quickly\\r\\nruns through all the possible changes; or is this exercise, even while\\r\\nit lasts, so delightful to a man who has a variety of intellectual\\r\\noccupations, as it frequently appears to him who knows scarcely any\\r\\nother species of mental activity? The vacillating state of mind,\\r\\npeculiar to hope and fear, is by no means favourable to industry; half\\r\\nour time is generally consumed in speculating upon the reward, instead\\r\\nof earning it, whenever the value of that reward is not _precisely\\r\\nascertainable_. In all occupations, where judgment or accurate\\r\\nobservation is essential, if the reward of our labour is brought\\r\\nsuddenly to excite our hope, there is an immediate interruption of all\\r\\neffectual labour; the thoughts take a new direction; the mind becomes\\r\\ntremulous, and nothing decisive can be done, till the emotions of hope\\r\\nand fear either subside or are vanquished.\\r\\n\\r\\nM. l\\'Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Chappe, who was sent by the king of France, at the desire of\\r\\nthe French Academy, to Siberia, to observe the transit of Venus, gives\\r\\nus a striking picture of the state of his own mind when the moment of\\r\\nthis famous observation approached. In the description of his own\\r\\nfeelings, this traveller may be admitted as good authority. A few\\r\\nhours before the observation, a black cloud appeared in the sky; the\\r\\nidea of returning to Paris, after such a long and perilous journey,\\r\\nwithout having seen the transit of Venus; the idea of the\\r\\ndisappointment to his king, to his country, to all the philosophers\\r\\nin Europe; threw him into a state of agitation, \"which must have been\\r\\nfelt to be conceived.\" At length the black cloud vanished; his hopes\\r\\naffected him almost as much as his fears had done; he fixed his\\r\\ntelescope, saw the planet; his eye wandered over the immense space a\\r\\nthousand times in a minute; his secretary stood on one side with his\\r\\npen in his hand; his assistant, with his eye fixed upon the watch, was\\r\\nstationed on the other side. The moment of the total immersion\\r\\narrived; the agitated philosopher was seized with an universal\\r\\nshivering, and could scarcely command his thoughts sufficiently to\\r\\nsecure the observation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe uncertainty of reward, and the consequent agitations of hope and\\r\\nfear, operate as unfavourably upon the moral as upon the intellectual\\r\\ncharacter. The favour of princes is an uncertain reward. Courtiers are\\r\\nusually despicable and wretched beings; they live upon hope; but their\\r\\nhope is not connected with exertion. Those who court popularity, are\\r\\nnot less despicable or less wretched; their reward is uncertain: what\\r\\nis more uncertain than the affection of the multitude? The Proteus\\r\\ncharacter of Wharton, so admirably drawn by Pope, is a striking\\r\\npicture of a man who has laboured through life with the vague _hope_\\r\\nof obtaining universal applause.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us suppose a child to be educated by a variety of persons, all\\r\\ndiffering in their tastes and tempers, and in their notions of right\\r\\nand wrong; all having the power to reward and punish their common\\r\\npupil. What must this pupil become? A mixture of incongruous\\r\\ncharacters; superstitious, enthusiastic, indolent, and perhaps\\r\\nprofligate: superstitious, because his own contradictory experience\\r\\nwould expose him to fear without reason; enthusiastic, because he\\r\\nwould, from the same cause, form absurd expectations; indolent,\\r\\nbecause the _will_ of others has been the measure of his happiness,\\r\\nand his own exertions have never procured him any certain reward;\\r\\nprofligate, because, probably from the confused variety of his moral\\r\\nlessons, he has at last concluded that right and wrong are but\\r\\nunmeaning words. Let us change the destiny of this child, by changing\\r\\nhis education. Place him under the sole care of a person of an\\r\\nenlarged capacity, and a steady mind; who has formed just notions of\\r\\nright and wrong; and who, in the distribution of reward and\\r\\npunishment, of praise and blame, will be prompt, exact, invariable.\\r\\nHis pupil will neither be credulous, rash, nor profligate; and he\\r\\ncertainly will not be indolent; his habitual and his rational belief\\r\\nwill, in all circumstances, agree with each other; his hope will be\\r\\nthe prelude to exertion, and his fear will restrain him only in\\r\\nsituations where action is dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven amongst children, we must frequently have observed a prodigious\\r\\ndifference in the quantity of hope and fear which is felt by those who\\r\\nhave been well or ill educated. An ill educated child, is in daily,\\r\\nhourly, alternate agonies of hope and fear; the present never occupies\\r\\nor interests him, but his soul is intent upon some future\\r\\ngratification, which never pays him by its full possession. As soon as\\r\\nhe awakens in the morning, he recollects some promised blessing, and,\\r\\ntill the happy moment arrives, he is wretched in impatience: at\\r\\nbreakfast he is to be blessed with some toy, that he is to have the\\r\\nmoment breakfast is finished; and when he finds the toy does not\\r\\ndelight him, he is _to be blessed_ with a sweet pudding at dinner, or\\r\\nwith sitting up half an hour later at night than his usual bed-time.\\r\\nEndeavour to find some occupation that shall amuse him, you will not\\r\\neasily succeed, for he will still anticipate what you are going to say\\r\\nor to do. \"What will come next?\" \"What shall we do after this?\" are,\\r\\nas Mr. Williams, in his able lectures upon education, observes, the\\r\\nquestions incessantly asked by spoiled children. This species of idle,\\r\\nrestless curiosity, does not lead to the acquisition of knowledge, it\\r\\nprevents the possibility of instruction; it is not the animation of a\\r\\nhealthy mind, it is the debility of an over-stimulated temper. There\\r\\nis a very sensible letter in Mrs. Macaulay\\'s book upon education, on\\r\\nthe impropriety of filling the imagination of young people with\\r\\nprospects of future enjoyment: the foolish system of promising great\\r\\nrewards, and fine presents, she clearly shows creates habitual\\r\\ndisorders in the minds of children.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe happiness of life depends more upon a succession of small\\r\\nenjoyments, than upon great pleasures; and those who become incapable\\r\\nof tasting the moderately agreeable sensations, cannot fill up the\\r\\nintervals of their existence between their great delights. The\\r\\nhappiness of childhood peculiarly depends upon their enjoyment of\\r\\n_little_ pleasures: of these they have a continual variety; they have\\r\\nperpetual occupation for their senses, in observing all the objects\\r\\naround them, and all their faculties may be exercised upon suitable\\r\\nsubjects. The pleasure of this exercise is in itself sufficient: we\\r\\nneed not say to a child, \"Look at the wings of this beautiful\\r\\nbutterfly, and I will give you a piece of plum-cake; observe how the\\r\\nbutterfly curls his proboscis, how he dives into the honeyed flowers,\\r\\nand I will take you in a coach to pay a visit with me, my dear.\\r\\nRemember the pretty story you read this morning, and you shall have a\\r\\nnew coat.\" Without the new coat, or the visit, or the plum-cake, the\\r\\nchild would have had sufficient amusement in the story and the sight\\r\\nof the butterfly\\'s proboscis: the rewards, besides, have no natural\\r\\nconnection with the things themselves; and they create, where they are\\r\\nmost liked, a taste for factitious pleasures. Would you encourage\\r\\nbenevolence, generosity, or prudence, let each have its appropriate\\r\\nreward of affection, esteem, and confidence;[76] but do not by\\r\\nill-judged bounties attempt to force these virtues into premature\\r\\ndisplay. The rewards which are given to benevolence and generosity in\\r\\nchildren, frequently encourage selfishness, and sometimes teach them\\r\\ncunning. Lord Kames tells us a story, which is precisely a case in\\r\\npoint. Two boys, the sons of the earl of Elgin, were permitted by\\r\\ntheir father to associate with the poor boys in the neighbourhood of\\r\\ntheir father\\'s house. One day, the earl\\'s sons being called to dinner,\\r\\na lad who was playing with them, said that he would wait until they\\r\\nreturned--\"There is no dinner for me at home,\" said the poor boy.\\r\\n\"Come with us, then,\" said the earl\\'s sons. The boy refused, and when\\r\\nthey asked him if he had any money to buy a dinner, he answered, \"No.\"\\r\\n\"Papa,\" said the eldest of the young gentlemen when he got home, \"what\\r\\nwas the price of the silver buckles you gave me?\" \"Five shillings.\"\\r\\n\"Let me have the money, and I\\'ll give you the buckles.\" It was done\\r\\naccordingly, says Lord Kames. The earl, inquiring privately, found\\r\\nthat the money was given to the lad _who had no dinner_. The buckles\\r\\nwere returned, and the boy was highly commended for being kind to his\\r\\ncompanion. The commendations were just, but the buckles should not\\r\\nhave been returned: the boy should have been suffered steadily to\\r\\nabide by his own bargain; he should have been let to feel the\\r\\npleasure, and pay the exact price of his own generosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we attempt to teach children that they can be generous, without\\r\\ngiving up some of their own pleasures for the sake of other people, we\\r\\nattempt to teach them what is false. If we once make them amends for\\r\\nany sacrifice they have made, we lead them to expect the same\\r\\nremuneration upon a future occasion; and then, in fact, they act with\\r\\na direct view to their own interest, and govern themselves by the\\r\\ncalculations of prudence, instead of following the dictates of\\r\\nbenevolence. It is true, that if we speak with accuracy, we must\\r\\nadmit, that the most benevolent and generous persons act from the hope\\r\\nof receiving pleasure, and their enjoyment is more exquisite than that\\r\\nof the most refined selfishness; in the language of M. de\\r\\nRochefoucault, we should therefore be forced to acknowledge, that the\\r\\nmost benevolent is always the most selfish person. This seeming\\r\\nparadox is answered, by observing, that the epithet _selfish_ is given\\r\\nto those who prefer pleasures in which other people have no share; we\\r\\nchange the meaning of words when we talk of its being selfish to like\\r\\nthe pleasures of sympathy or benevolence, because these pleasures\\r\\ncannot be confined solely to the idea of self. When we say that a\\r\\nperson pursues his own interest more by being generous than by being\\r\\ncovetous, we take into the account the general sum of his agreeable\\r\\nfeelings; we do not balance prudentially his loss or gain upon\\r\\nparticular occasions. The generous man may himself be convinced, that\\r\\nthe sum of his happiness is more increased by the feelings of\\r\\nbenevolence, than it could be by the gratification of avarice; but,\\r\\nthough his understanding may perceive the demonstration of this moral\\r\\ntheorem, though it is the remote principle of his whole conduct, it\\r\\ndoes not occur to his memory in the form of a prudential aphorism,\\r\\nwhenever he is going to do a generous action. It is essential to our\\r\\nideas of generosity, that no such reasoning should, at that moment,\\r\\npass in his mind; we know that the feelings of generosity are\\r\\nassociated with a number of enthusiastic ideas; we can sympathize with\\r\\nthe virtuous insanity of the man who forgets himself whilst he thinks\\r\\nof others; we do not so readily sympathize with the cold strength of\\r\\nmind of the person, who, deliberately preferring _the greatest\\r\\npossible share of happiness_, is benevolent by rule and measure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether we are just or not, in refusing our sympathy to the man of\\r\\nreason, and in giving our spontaneous approbation to the man of\\r\\nenthusiasm, we shall not here examine. But the reasonable man, who has\\r\\nbeen convinced of this propensity in human nature, will take it into\\r\\nhis calculations; he will perceive, that he loses, in losing the\\r\\npleasure of sympathy, part of the sum total of his possible happiness;\\r\\nhe will consequently wish, that he could add this item of pleasure to\\r\\nthe credit side of his account. This, however, he cannot accomplish,\\r\\nbecause, though he can by reason correct his calculations, it is not\\r\\nin the power, even of the most potent reason, suddenly to break\\r\\nhabitual associations; much less is it in the power of cool reason to\\r\\nconjure up warm enthusiasm. Yet in this case, enthusiasm _is the thing\\r\\nrequired_.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat the man of reason cannot do for himself after his associations\\r\\nare strongly formed, might have been easily accomplished in his early\\r\\neducation. He might have been taught the same general principles, but\\r\\nwith different habits. By early associating the pleasures of sympathy,\\r\\nand praise, and affection with all generous and benevolent actions,\\r\\nhis parents might have joined these ideas so forcibly in his mind,\\r\\nthat the one set of ideas should never recur without the other.\\r\\nWhenever the words benevolence or generosity were pronounced, the\\r\\nfeelings of habitual pleasure would recur; and he would, independently\\r\\nof reason, desire from association to be generous. When enthusiasm is\\r\\nfairly justified by reason, we have nothing to fear from her\\r\\nvehemence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn rewarding children for the prudential virtues, such as order,\\r\\ncleanliness, economy, temperance, &c. we should endeavour to make the\\r\\nrewards the immediate consequence of the virtues themselves; and at\\r\\nthe same time, approbation should be shown in speaking of these useful\\r\\nqualities. A gradation must, however, always be observed in our\\r\\npraises of different virtues; those that are the most useful to\\r\\nsociety, as truth, justice and humanity, must stand the highest in the\\r\\nscale; those that are most agreeable, claim the next place. Those good\\r\\nqualities, which must wait a considerable time for their reward, such\\r\\nas perseverance, prudence, &c. we must not expect early from young\\r\\npeople. Till they have had experience, how can they form any idea\\r\\nabout the future? Till they have been punctually rewarded for their\\r\\nindustry, or for their prudence, they do not feel the value of\\r\\nprudence and perseverance. Time is necessary to all these lessons, and\\r\\nthose who leave time out in their calculations, will always be\\r\\ndisappointed in whatever plan of education they may pursue.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany, to whom the subject is familiar, will be fatigued, probably, by\\r\\nthe detailed manner in which it has been thought necessary to explain\\r\\nthe principles by which we should guide ourselves in the distribution\\r\\nof rewards and punishments to children. Those who quickly seize, and\\r\\napply, general ideas, cannot endure, with patience, the tedious\\r\\nminuteness of didactic illustration. Those who are actually engaged in\\r\\n_practical education_, will not, on the contrary, be satisfied with\\r\\ngeneral precepts; and, however plausible any theory may appear, they\\r\\nare well aware that its utility must depend upon a variety of small\\r\\ncircumstances, to which writers of theories often neglect to advert.\\r\\nAt the hazard of being thought tedious, those must be minute in\\r\\nexplanation who desire to be generally useful. An old French\\r\\nwriter,[77] more remarkable for originality of thought, than for the\\r\\ngraces of style, was once reproached _by a friend_ with the frequent\\r\\nrepetitions which were to be found in his works. \"Name them to me,\"\\r\\nsaid the author. The critic, with obliging precision, mentioned all\\r\\nthe ideas which had most frequently recurred in the book. \"I am\\r\\nsatisfied,\" replied the honest author; \"you remember my ideas; I\\r\\nrepeated them so often to prevent you from forgetting them. Without my\\r\\nrepetitions, we should never have succeeded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[61] V.

Those who have any\\r\\ninterest in the education of children, have yet a higher sense of\\r\\npleasure in observing symptoms of their sensibility; they anticipate\\r\\nthe future virtues which early sensibility seems certainly to promise;\\r\\nthe future happiness which these virtues will diffuse. Nor are they\\r\\nunsupported by philosophy in these sanguine hopes. No theory was ever\\r\\ndeveloped with more ingenious elegance, than that which deduces all\\r\\nour moral sentiments from sympathy. The direct influence of sympathy\\r\\nupon all social beings, is sufficiently obvious, and we immediately\\r\\nperceive its necessary connection with compassion, friendship, and\\r\\nbenevolence; but the subject becomes more intricate when we are to\\r\\nanalyse our sense of propriety and justice; of merit and demerit; of\\r\\ngratitude and resentment; self-complacency or remorse; ambition and\\r\\nshame.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe allow, without hesitation, that a being destitute of sympathy,\\r\\ncould never have any of these feelings, and must, consequently, be\\r\\nincapable of all intercourse with society; yet we must at the same\\r\\ntime perceive, that a being endowed with the most exquisite sympathy,\\r\\nmust, without the assistance and education of reason, be, if not\\r\\nequally incapable of social intercourse, far more dangerous to the\\r\\nhappiness of society. A person governed by sympathy alone, must be\\r\\ninfluenced by the bad as well as by the good passions of others; he\\r\\nmust feel resentment with the angry man; hatred with the malevolent;\\r\\njealousy with the jealous; and avarice with the miser: the more lively\\r\\nhis sympathy with these painful feelings, the greater must be his\\r\\nmisery; the more forcibly he is impelled to action by this sympathetic\\r\\ninfluence, the greater, probably, must be his imprudence and his\\r\\nguilt. Let us even suppose a being capable of sympathy only with the\\r\\nbest feelings of his fellow-creatures, still, without the direction of\\r\\nreason, he would be a nuisance in the world; his pity would stop the\\r\\nhand, and overturn the balance of justice; his love would be as\\r\\ndangerous as his pity; his gratitude would exalt his benefactor at the\\r\\nexpense of the whole human race; his sympathy with the rich, the\\r\\nprosperous, the great, and the fortunate, would be so sudden, and so\\r\\nviolent, as to leave him no time for reflection upon the consequences\\r\\nof tyranny, or the miseries occasioned by monopoly. No time for\\r\\nreflection, did we say? We forgot that we were speaking of a being\\r\\ndestitute of the reasoning faculty! Such a being, no matter what his\\r\\nvirtuous sympathies might be, must act either like a madman or a fool.\\r\\nOn sympathy we cannot depend, either for the correctness of a man\\'s\\r\\nmoral sentiments, or for the steadiness of his moral conduct. It is\\r\\nvery common to talk of the excellence of a person\\'s heart, of the\\r\\nnatural goodness of his disposition; when these expressions distinctly\\r\\nmean any thing, they must refer to natural sympathy, or a superior\\r\\ndegree of sensibility. Experience, however, does not teach us, that\\r\\nsensibility and virtue have any certain connection with each other. No\\r\\none can read the works of Sterne, or of Rousseau, without believing\\r\\nthese men to have been endowed with extraordinary sensibility; yet,\\r\\nwho would propose their conduct in life as a model for imitation? That\\r\\nquickness of sympathy with present objects of distress, which\\r\\nconstitutes compassion, is usually thought a virtue, but it is a\\r\\nvirtue frequently found in persons of an abandoned character.\\r\\nMandeville, in his essay upon Charity Schools, puts this in a strong\\r\\nlight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Should any one of us,\" says he, \"be locked up in a ground room,\\r\\nwhere, in a yard joining to it, there was a thriving good humoured\\r\\nchild at play, of two or three years old, so near us, that through the\\r\\ngrates of the window we could almost touch it with our hands; and if,\\r\\nwhilst we took delight in the harmless diversion, and imperfect\\r\\nprattle, of the innocent babe, a nasty overgrown sow should come in\\r\\nupon the child, set it a screaming, and frighten it out of its wits;\\r\\nit is natural to think that this would make us uneasy, and that with\\r\\ncrying out, and making all the menacing noise we could, we should\\r\\nendeavour to drive the sow away--But if this should happen to be an\\r\\nhalf-starved creature, that, mad with hunger, went roaming about in\\r\\nquest of food, and we should behold the ravenous brute, in spite of\\r\\nour cries, and all the threatening gestures we could think of,\\r\\nactually lay hold of the helpless infant, destroy, and devour it;--to\\r\\nsee her widely open her destructive jaws, and the poor lamb beat down\\r\\nwith greedy haste; to look on the defenceless posture of tender limbs\\r\\nfirst trampled upon, then torn asunder; to see the filthy snout\\r\\ndigging in the yet living entrails, suck up the smoking blood, and now\\r\\nand then to hear the crackling of the bones, and the cruel animal\\r\\ngrunt with savage pleasure over the horrid banquet; to hear and see\\r\\nall this, what torture would it give the soul beyond expression!******\\r\\nNot only a man of humanity, of good morals, and commiseration, but\\r\\nlikewise an highwayman, an house-breaker, or a murderer, could feel\\r\\nanxieties on such an occasion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst those monsters, who are pointed out by the historian to the\\r\\njust detestation of all mankind, we meet with instances of casual\\r\\nsympathy and sensibility; even their vices frequently prove to us,\\r\\nthat they never became utterly indifferent to the opinion and feelings\\r\\nof their fellow-creatures. The dissimulation, jealousy, suspicion,\\r\\nand cruelty of Tiberius, originated, perhaps, more in his anxiety\\r\\nabout the opinions which were formed of his character, than in his\\r\\nfears of any conspiracies against his life. The _\"judge within,\" the\\r\\nhabit of viewing his own conduct in the light in which it was beheld\\r\\nby the impartial spectator_, prompted him to new crimes; and thus his\\r\\nunextinguished sympathy, and his exasperated sensibility, drove him to\\r\\nexcesses, from which a more torpid temperament might have preserved\\r\\nhim.[79] When, upon his presenting the sons of Germanicus to the\\r\\nsenate, Tiberius beheld the tenderness with which these young men were\\r\\nreceived, he was moved to such an agony of jealousy, as instantly to\\r\\nbeseech the senate that he might resign the empire. We cannot\\r\\nattribute either to policy or fear, this strong emotion, because we\\r\\nknow that the senate was at this time absolutely at the disposal of\\r\\nTiberius, and the lives of the sons of Germanicus depended upon his\\r\\npleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe desire to excel, according to \"Smith\\'s Theory of Moral\\r\\nSentiments,\" is to be resolved principally into our love of the\\r\\nsympathy of our fellow-creatures. We wish for their sympathy, either\\r\\nin our success, or in the pleasure we feel in superiority. The desire\\r\\nfor this refined modification of sympathy, may be the motive of good\\r\\nand great actions; but it cannot be trusted as a moral principle.\\r\\nNero\\'s love of sympathy, made him anxious to be applauded on the stage\\r\\nas a fiddler and a buffoon. Tiberius banished one of his philosophic\\r\\ncourtiers, and persecuted him till the unfortunate man laid violent\\r\\nhands upon himself, merely because he had discovered that the emperour\\r\\nread books in the morning to prepare himself with questions for his\\r\\nliterary society at night. Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse, sued in\\r\\nthe most abject manner for an Olympic crown, and sent a critic to the\\r\\ngalleys for finding fault with his verses. Had not these men a\\r\\nsufficient degree of sensibility to praise, and more than a\\r\\nsufficient desire for the sympathy of their fellow-creatures?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not from any perverse love of sophistry, that the word\\r\\nsensibility has been used in these instances instead of\\r\\n_irritability_, which seems better to characterize the temper of a\\r\\nDionysius, or a Tiberius; but, in fact, irritability, in common\\r\\nlanguage, merely denotes an excessive or ill governed degree of\\r\\nsensibility. The point of excess must be marked: sympathy must be\\r\\nregulated by education, and consequently the methods of directing\\r\\nsensibility to useful and amiable purposes, must be anxiously studied\\r\\nby all who wish either for the happiness or virtue of their pupils.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong before children can understand reasoning, they can feel sympathy;\\r\\nduring this early period of their education, example and habit, slight\\r\\nexternal circumstances, and the propensity to imitation, govern their\\r\\nthoughts and actions. Imitation is the involuntary effect of sympathy\\r\\nin children; hence those who have the most sympathy, are most liable\\r\\nto be improved or injured by early examples. Examples of the\\r\\nmalevolent passions, should therefore be most carefully excluded from\\r\\nthe sight of those who have yet no choice in their sympathy;\\r\\nexpressions of kindness and affection in the countenance, the voice,\\r\\nthe actions, of all who approach, and of all who have the care of\\r\\ninfants, are not only immediately and evidently agreeable to the\\r\\nchildren, but ought also to be used as the best possible means of\\r\\nexciting benevolent sympathies in their mind. Children, who habitually\\r\\nmeet with kindness, habitually feel complacency; that species of\\r\\ninstinctive, or rather of associated affection, which always rises in\\r\\nthe mind from the recollection of past pleasures, is immediately\\r\\nexcited in such children by the sight of their parents. By an easy\\r\\ntransition of ideas, they expect the same benevolence, even from\\r\\nstrangers, which they have experienced from their friends, and their\\r\\nsympathy naturally prepares them to wish for society; this wish is\\r\\noften improperly indulged.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age when children begin to unfold their ideas, and to express\\r\\ntheir thoughts in words, they are such interesting and entertaining\\r\\ncompanions, that they attract a large portion of our daily attention:\\r\\nwe listen eagerly to their simple observations; we enter into their\\r\\nyoung astonishment at every new object; we are delighted to watch all\\r\\ntheir emotions; we help them with words to express their ideas; we\\r\\nanxiously endeavour to understand their imperfect reasonings, and are\\r\\npleased to find, or put them in the right. This season of universal\\r\\nsmiles and courtesy, is delightful to children whilst it lasts, but it\\r\\nsoon passes away; they soon speak without exciting any astonishment,\\r\\nand instead of meeting with admiration for every attempt to express an\\r\\nidea, they are soon repulsed for troublesome volubility; even when\\r\\nthey talk sense, they are suffered to talk unheard, or else they are\\r\\nchecked for unbecoming presumption. Children feel this change in\\r\\npublic opinion and manners most severely; they are not sensible of any\\r\\nchange in themselves, except, perhaps, they are conscious of having\\r\\nimproved both in sense and language. This unmerited loss of their late\\r\\ngratuitous allowance of sympathy, usually operates unfavourably upon\\r\\nthe temper of the sufferers; they become shy and silent, and reserved,\\r\\nif not sullen; they withdraw from our capricious society, and they\\r\\nendeavour to console themselves with other pleasures. It is difficult\\r\\nto them to feel contented with their own little occupations and\\r\\namusements, for want of the spectators and the audience which used to\\r\\nbe at their command. Children of a timid temper, or of an indolent\\r\\ndisposition, are quite dispirited and bereft of all energy in these\\r\\ncircumstances; others, with greater vivacity, and more voluntary\\r\\nexertion, endeavour to supply the loss of universal sympathy, by the\\r\\ninvention of independent occupations; but they feel anger and\\r\\nindignation, when they are not rewarded with any smiles or any praise\\r\\nfor their \"virtuous toil.\" They naturally seek for new companions,\\r\\neither amongst children of their own age, or amongst complaisant\\r\\nservants. Immediately all the business of education is at a stand; for\\r\\nneither these servants, nor these playfellows, are capable of becoming\\r\\ntheir instructers; nor can tutors hope to succeed, who have\\r\\ntransferred their power over the pleasures, and consequently over the\\r\\naffections of their pupils. Sympathy now becomes the declared enemy of\\r\\nall the constituted authorities. What chance is there of obedience or\\r\\nof happiness, under such a government?\\r\\n\\r\\nWould it not be more prudent to prevent, than to complain of these\\r\\nevils? Sympathy is our first, best friend, in education, and by\\r\\njudicious management, might long continue our faithful ally.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of lavishing our smiles and our attention upon young children\\r\\nfor a short period, just at that age when they are amusing playthings,\\r\\nshould we not do more wisely if we reserved some portion of our\\r\\nkindness a few years longer? By a proper _economy_, our sympathy may\\r\\nlast for many years, and may continually contribute to the most useful\\r\\npurposes. Instead of accustoming our pupils early to such a degree of\\r\\nour attention as cannot be supported long on our parts, we should\\r\\nrather suffer them to feel a little ennui, at that age when they can\\r\\nhave but few independent or useful occupations. We should employ\\r\\nourselves in our usual manner, and converse, without allowing children\\r\\nto interrupt us with frivolous prattle; but whenever they ask sensible\\r\\nquestions, make just observations, or show a disposition to acquire\\r\\nknowledge, we should assist and encourage them with praise and\\r\\naffection; gradually as they become capable of taking any part in\\r\\nconversation, they should be admitted into society, and they will\\r\\nlearn of themselves, or we may teach them, that useful and agreeable\\r\\nqualities are those by which they must secure the pleasures of\\r\\nsympathy. Esteem, being associated with sympathy, will increase its\\r\\nvalue, and this connection should be made as soon, and kept as sacred,\\r\\nin the mind as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith respect to the sympathy which children feel for each other, it\\r\\nmust be carefully managed, or it will counteract, instead of assisting\\r\\nus, in education. It is natural, that those who are placed nearly in\\r\\nthe same circumstances, should feel alike, and sympathize with one\\r\\nanother; but children feel only for the present; they have few ideas\\r\\nof the future; and consequently all that they can desire, either for\\r\\nthemselves, or for their companions, is what will _immediately_\\r\\nplease. Education looks to the future, and frequently we must ensure\\r\\nfuture advantage, even at the expense of present pain or restraint.\\r\\nThe companion and the tutor then, supposing each to be equally good\\r\\nand equally kind, must command, in a very different degree, the\\r\\nsympathy of the child. It may, notwithstanding, be questioned, whether\\r\\nthose who are constant companions in their idle hours, when they are\\r\\n_very_ young, are likely to be either as fond of one another when they\\r\\ngrow up, or even as happy whilst they are children, as those are who\\r\\nspend less time together. Whenever the humours, interests, and\\r\\npassions of others cross our own, there is an end of sympathy, and\\r\\nthis happens almost every hour in the day with children; it is\\r\\ngenerally supposed, that they learn to live in friendship with each\\r\\nother, and to bear with one another\\'s little faults habitually; that\\r\\nthey even reciprocally cure these faults, and learn, by experience,\\r\\nthose principles of honour and justice on which society depends. We\\r\\nmay be deceived in this reasoning by a false analogy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe call the society of children, _society in miniature_; the\\r\\nproportions of the miniature are so much altered, that it is by no\\r\\nmeans an accurate resemblance of that which exists in the _civilized_\\r\\nworld. Amongst children of different ages, strength, and talents,\\r\\nthere must always be tyranny, injustice, and that worst species of\\r\\ninequality, which arises from superior force on the one side, and\\r\\nabject timidity on the other. Of this, the spectators of juvenile\\r\\ndisputes and quarrels are sometimes sensible, and they hastily\\r\\ninterfere and endeavour to part the combatants, by pronouncing certain\\r\\nmoral sentences, such as, \"Good boys never quarrel; brothers must\\r\\nlove and help one another.\" But these sentences seldom operate as a\\r\\ncharm upon the angry passions; the parties concerned, hearing it\\r\\nasserted that they must love one another, at the very instant when\\r\\nthey happen to feel that they cannot, are still further exasperated,\\r\\nand they stand at bay, sullen in hatred, or approach hypocritical in\\r\\nreconciliation. It is more easy to prevent occasions of dispute, than\\r\\nto remedy the bad consequences which petty altercations produce. Young\\r\\nchildren should be kept asunder at all times, and in all situations,\\r\\nin which it is necessary, or probable, that their appetites and\\r\\npassions should be in direct competition. Two hungry children, with\\r\\ntheir eager eyes fixed upon one and the same bason of bread and milk,\\r\\ndo not sympathize with each other, though they have the same\\r\\nsensations; each perceives, that if the other eats the bread and milk,\\r\\nhe cannot eat it. Hunger is more powerful than sympathy; but satisfy\\r\\nthe hunger of one of the parties, and immediately he will begin to\\r\\nfeel for his companion, and will wish that _his_ hunger should also be\\r\\nsatisfied. Even Mr. Barnet, the epicure, who is so well described in\\r\\nMoore\\'s excellent novel,[80] _after_ he has crammed himself to the\\r\\nthroat, asks his wife to \"try to eat a bit.\" Intelligent preceptors\\r\\nwill apply the instance of the bason of bread and milk, in a variety\\r\\nof apparently dissimilar circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may observe, that the more quickly children reason, the sooner they\\r\\ndiscover how far their interests are any ways incompatible with the\\r\\ninterests of their companions. The more readily a boy calculates, the\\r\\nsooner he will perceive, that if he were to share his bason of bread\\r\\nand milk equally with a dozen of his companions, his own portion must\\r\\nbe small. The accuracy of his mental division would prevent him from\\r\\noffering to part with that share which, perhaps, a more ignorant\\r\\naccountant would be ready to surrender at once, without being on that\\r\\naccount more generous. Children, who are accurate observers of the\\r\\ncountenance, and who have a superior degree of penetration, discover\\r\\nvery early the symptoms of displeasure, or of affection, in their\\r\\nfriends; they also perceive quickly the dangers of rivalship from\\r\\ntheir companions. If experience convinces them, that they must lose in\\r\\nproportion as their companions gain, either in fame or in favour, they\\r\\nwill necessarily dislike them as rivals; their hatred will be as\\r\\nvehement, as their love of praise and affection is ardent. Thus\\r\\nchildren, who have the most lively sympathy, are, unless they be\\r\\njudiciously educated, the most in danger of feeling early the\\r\\nmalevolent passions of jealousy and envy. It is inhuman, and in every\\r\\npoint of view unjustifiable in us, to excite these painful feelings in\\r\\nchildren, as we too often do, by the careless or partial distribution\\r\\nof affection and applause. Exact justice will best prevent jealousy;\\r\\neach individual submits to justice, because each, in turn, feels the\\r\\nbenefit of its protection. Some preceptors, with benevolent\\r\\nintentions, labour to preserve a perfect equality amongst their\\r\\npupils, and, from the fear of exciting envy in those who are inferior,\\r\\navoid uttering any encomiums upon superior talents and merit. This\\r\\nmanagement seldom succeeds; the truth cannot be concealed; those who\\r\\nfeel their own superiority, make painful reflections upon the\\r\\ninjustice done to them by the policy of their tutors; those who are\\r\\nsensible of their own inferiority, are not comforted by the courtesy\\r\\nand humiliating forbearance with which they are treated. It is,\\r\\ntherefore, best to speak the plain truth; to give to all their due\\r\\nshare of affection and applause: at the same time, we should avoid\\r\\nblaming one child at the moment when we praise another: we should\\r\\nnever put our pupils in contrast with one another; nor yet should we\\r\\ndeceive them as to their respective excellences and defects. Our\\r\\ncomparison should rather be made between what the pupil _has been_,\\r\\nand what he _is_, than between what he _is_, and what any body else\\r\\n_is not_.[81] By this style of praise we may induce children to become\\r\\nemulous of their former selves, instead of being envious of their\\r\\ncompetitors. Without deceit or affectation, we may also take care to\\r\\nassociate general pleasure in a family with particular commendations:\\r\\nthus, if one boy is remarkable for prudence, and another for\\r\\ngenerosity, we should not praise the generosity of the one at the\\r\\nexpense of the prudence of the other, but we should give to each\\r\\nvirtue its just measure of applause. If one girl sings, and another\\r\\ndraws, remarkably well, we may show that we are pleased with both\\r\\nagreeable accomplishments, without bringing them into comparison. Nor\\r\\nis it necessary that we should be in a desperate hurry to balance the\\r\\nseparate degrees of praise which we distribute exactly at the same\\r\\nmoment, because if children are sure that the reward of their industry\\r\\nand ingenuity is secured by our justice, they will trust to us, though\\r\\nthat reward may be for a few hours delayed. It is only where workmen\\r\\nhave no confidence in the integrity or punctuality of their masters,\\r\\nthat they are impatient of any accidental delay in the payment of\\r\\ntheir wages.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the precautions which have been mentioned, we may hope to see\\r\\nchildren grow up in real friendship together. The whole sum of their\\r\\npleasure is much increased by mutual sympathy. This happy moral truth,\\r\\nupon which so many of our virtues depend, should be impressed upon the\\r\\nmind; it should be clearly demonstrated to the reason; it should not\\r\\nbe repeated as an a priori, sentimental assertion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who have observed the sudden, violent, and surprising effects of\\r\\nemulation in public schools, will regret the want of this _power_ in\\r\\nthe intellectual education of their pupils at home. Even the\\r\\nacquisition of talents and knowledge ought, however, to be but a\\r\\nsecondary consideration, subordinate to the general happiness of our\\r\\npupils. If we _could_ have superior knowledge, upon condition that we\\r\\nshould have a malevolent disposition, and an irritable temper, should\\r\\nwe, setting every other moral consideration aside, be willing to make\\r\\nthe purchase at such a price? Let any person, desirous to see a\\r\\nstriking picture of the effects of scholastic competition upon the\\r\\nmoral character, look at the life of that wonder of his age, the\\r\\ncelebrated Abeillard. As the taste and manners of the present times\\r\\nare so different from those of the age in which he lived, we see,\\r\\nwithout any species of deception, the real value of the learning in\\r\\nwhich he excelled, and we can judge both of his acquirements, and of\\r\\nhis character, without prejudice. We see him goaded on by rivalship,\\r\\nand literary ambition, to astonishing exertions at one time; at\\r\\nanother, torpid in monkish indolence: at one time, we see him\\r\\nintoxicated with adulation; at another, listless, desponding, abject,\\r\\nincapable of maintaining his own self-approbation without the\\r\\nsuffrages of those whom he despised. If his biographer[82] does him\\r\\njustice, a more selfish, irritable, contemptible, miserable being,\\r\\nthan the learned Abeillard, could scarcely exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nA philosopher,[83] who, if we might judge of him by the benignity of\\r\\nhis writings, was surely of a most amiable and happy temper, has yet\\r\\nleft us a melancholy and discouraging history of the unsociable\\r\\ncondition of men of superior knowledge and abilities. He supposes that\\r\\nthose who have devoted much time to the cultivation of their\\r\\nunderstandings, have habitually less sympathy, or less exercise for\\r\\ntheir sympathy, than those who live less abstracted from the world;\\r\\nthat, consequently, \"all their social, and all their public\\r\\naffections, lose their natural warmth and vigour,\" whilst their\\r\\nselfish passions are cherished and strengthened, being kept in\\r\\nconstant play by literary rivalship. It is to be hoped, that there\\r\\nare men of the most extensive learning and genius, now living, who\\r\\ncould, from their own experience, assure us that those are obsolete\\r\\nobservations, no longer applicable to modern human nature. At all\\r\\nevents, we, who refer so much to education, are hopefully of opinion,\\r\\nthat education can prevent these evils, in common with _almost_ all\\r\\nthe other evils of life. It would be an errour, fatal to all\\r\\nimprovement, to believe that the cultivation of the understanding,\\r\\nimpedes the exercise of the social affections. Obviously, a man, who\\r\\nsecludes himself from the world, and whose whole life is occupied with\\r\\nabstract studies, cannot enjoy any pleasure from his social\\r\\naffections; his admiration of the dead, is so constant, that he has no\\r\\ntime to feel any sympathy with the living. An individual, of this\\r\\nruminating species, is humorously delineated in Mrs. D\\'Arblay\\'s\\r\\nCamilla. Men, who are compelled to unrelenting labour, whether by\\r\\navarice, or by literary ambition, are equally to be pitied. They are\\r\\nnot models for imitation; they sacrifice their happiness to some\\r\\nstrong passion or interest. Without this ascetic abstinence from the\\r\\ndomestic and social pleasures of life, surely persons may cultivate\\r\\ntheir understandings, and acquire, even by mixing with their\\r\\nfellow-creatures, a variety of useful knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn ingenious theory[84] supposes the exercise of any of our faculties,\\r\\nis always attended with pleasure, which lasts as long as that exercise\\r\\ncan be continued without fatigue. This pleasure, arising from the due\\r\\nexercise of our mental powers, the author of this theory maintains to\\r\\nbe the foundation of our most agreeable sentiments. If there be any\\r\\ntruth in these ideas, of how many agreeable sentiments must a man of\\r\\nsense be capable! The pleasures of society must to him increase in an\\r\\nalmost incalculable proportion; because, in conversation, his\\r\\nfaculties can never want subjects on which they may be amply\\r\\nexercised. The dearth of conversation, which every body may have felt\\r\\nin certain company, is always attended with mournful countenances, and\\r\\nevery symptom of ennui. Indeed, without the pleasures of conversation,\\r\\nsociety is reduced to meetings of people, who assemble to eat and\\r\\ndrink, to show their fine clothes, to weary and to hate one another.\\r\\nThe sympathy of bon vivants is, it must be acknowleged, very lively\\r\\nand sincere towards each other; but this can last only during the hour\\r\\nof dinner, unless they revive, and prolong, by the powers of\\r\\nimagination, the memory of the feast. Some foreign traveller[85] tells\\r\\nus, that \"every year, at Naples, an officer of the police goes through\\r\\nthe city, attended by a trumpeter, who proclaims in all the squares\\r\\nand cross-ways, how many thousand oxen, calves, lambs, hogs, &c. the\\r\\nNeapolitans have had the honour of eating in the course of the year.\"\\r\\nThe people all listen with extreme attention to this proclamation, and\\r\\nare immoderately delighted at the huge amount.\\r\\n\\r\\nA degree, and scarcely one degree, above the brute sympathy of good\\r\\neaters, is that gregarious propensity which is sometimes honoured with\\r\\nthe name of sociability. The current sympathy, or appearance of\\r\\nsympathy, which is to be found amongst the idle and frivolous in\\r\\nfashionable life, is wholly unconnected with even the idea of esteem.\\r\\nIt is therefore pernicious to all who partake of it; it excites to no\\r\\ngreat exertions; it rewards neither useful nor amiable qualities: on\\r\\nthe contrary, it is to be obtained by vice, rather than by virtue; by\\r\\nfolly much more readily than by wisdom. It is the mere follower of\\r\\nfashion, and of dissipation, and it keeps those in humour and\\r\\ncountenance, who ought to hear the voice of public reproach, and who\\r\\nmight be roused by the fear of disgrace, or the feelings of shame, to\\r\\nexertions which should justly entitle them to the approbation and\\r\\naffection of honourable friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung people, who are early in life content with this _convivial_\\r\\nsympathy, may, in the common phrase, become _very good, pleasant\\r\\ncompanions_; but there is little chance that they should ever become\\r\\nany thing more, and there is great danger that they may be led into\\r\\nany degree of folly, extravagance, or vice, to which fashion and the\\r\\nvoice of numbers invite. It sometimes happens, that men of superior\\r\\nabilities, have such an indiscriminate love of applause and sympathy,\\r\\nthat they reduce themselves to the standard of all their casual\\r\\ncompanions, and vary their objects of ambition with the opinion of the\\r\\nsilly people with whom they chance to associate. In public life, party\\r\\nspirit becomes the ruling principle of men of this character; in\\r\\nprivate life, they are addicted to clubs, and associations of all\\r\\nsorts, in which the contagion of sympathy has a power which the sober\\r\\ninfluence of reason seldom ventures to correct. The waste of talents,\\r\\nand the total loss of principle, to which this indiscriminate love of\\r\\nsympathy leads, should warn us to guard against its influence by early\\r\\neducation. The gregarious propensity in childhood, should not be\\r\\nindulged without precautions: unless their companions are well\\r\\neducated, we can never be reasonably secure of the conduct or\\r\\nhappiness of our pupils: from sympathy, they catch all the wishes,\\r\\ntastes, and ideas of those with whom they associate; and what is still\\r\\nworse, they acquire the dangerous habits of resting upon the support,\\r\\nand of wanting the stimulus of numbers. It is, surely, far more\\r\\nprudent to let children feel a little ennui, from the want of\\r\\noccupation and of company, than to purchase for them the juvenile\\r\\npleasures of society at the expense of their future happiness.\\r\\nChildhood, as a part of our existence, ought to have as great a share\\r\\nof happiness as it can enjoy compatibly with the advantage of the\\r\\nother seasons of life. By this principle, we should be guided in all\\r\\nwhich we allow, and in all which we refuse, to children; by this rule,\\r\\nwe may avoid unnecessary severity, and pernicious indulgence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs young people gradually acquire knowledge, they will learn to\\r\\n_converse_, and when they have the habits of conversing rationally,\\r\\nthey will not desire companions who can only chatter. They will prefer\\r\\nthe company of friends, who can sympathize in their occupations, to\\r\\nthe presence of ignorant idlers, who can fill up the void of ideas\\r\\nwith nonsense and noise. Some people have a notion that the\\r\\nunderstanding and the _heart_ are not to be educated at the same time;\\r\\nbut the very reverse of this is, perhaps, true; neither can be brought\\r\\nto any perfection, unless both are cultivated together.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe should not, therefore, expect premature virtues. During childhood,\\r\\nthere occur but few opportunities of exerting the virtues which are\\r\\nrecommended in books, such as humanity and generosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _humanity_ of children cannot, perhaps, properly be said to be\\r\\nexercised upon animals; they are frequently extremely fond of animals,\\r\\nbut they are not always equable in their fondness; they sometimes\\r\\ntreat their favourites with that caprice which favourites are doomed\\r\\nto experience; this caprice degenerates into cruelty, if it is\\r\\nresented by the sufferer. We must not depend merely upon the natural\\r\\nfeelings of compassion, as preservatives against cruelty; the\\r\\n_instinctive_ feelings of compassion, are strong amongst uneducated\\r\\npeople; yet these do not restrain them from acts of cruelty. They take\\r\\ndelight, it has been often observed, in all tragical, sanguinary\\r\\nspectacles, because these excite emotion, and relieve them from the\\r\\nlistless state in which their days usually pass. It is the same with\\r\\nall persons, in all ranks of life, whose minds are uncultivated.[86]\\r\\nUntil young people have fixed _habits_ of benevolence, and a taste for\\r\\noccupation, perhaps it is not prudent to trust them with the care or\\r\\nprotection of animals. Even when they are enthusiastically fond of\\r\\nthem, they cannot, by their utmost ingenuity, make the animal so happy\\r\\nin a state of captivity, as they would be in a state of liberty. They\\r\\nare apt to insist upon doing animals good against their will, and\\r\\nthey are often unjust in the defence of their favourites. A boy of\\r\\nseven years old, once knocked down his sister, to prevent her crushing\\r\\nhis caterpillar.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren should not be taught to confine their benevolence to those\\r\\nanimals which are thought beautiful; the fear and disgust which we\\r\\nexpress at the sight of certain unfortunate animals, whom we are\\r\\npleased to call ugly and shocking, are observed by children, and these\\r\\nassociations lead to cruelty. If we do not prejudice our pupils by\\r\\nfoolish exclamations; if they do not, from sympathy, catch our absurd\\r\\nantipathies, their benevolence towards the animal world, will not be\\r\\nilliberally confined to favourite lap-dogs and singing-birds. From\\r\\nassociation, most people think that frogs are ugly animals. L----, a\\r\\nboy between five and six years old, once begged his mother to come out\\r\\nto look at a _beautiful_ animal which he had just found; she was\\r\\nrather surprised to find that this beautiful creature was a frog.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf children never see others torment animals, they will not think that\\r\\ncruelty can be an amusement; but they may be provoked to revenge the\\r\\npain which is inflicted upon them; and therefore we should take care\\r\\nnot to put children in situations where they are liable to be hurt or\\r\\nterrified by animals. Could we possibly expect, that Gulliver should\\r\\nlove the Brobdignagian wasp that buzzed round his cake, and prevented\\r\\nhim from eating his breakfast? Could we expect that Gulliver should be\\r\\never reconciled to the rat against whom he was obliged to draw his\\r\\nsword? Many animals are, to children, what the wasp and the rat were\\r\\nto Gulliver. Put bodily fear out of the case, it required all uncle\\r\\nToby\\'s benevolence to bear the buzzing of a gnat while he was eating\\r\\nhis dinner. Children, even when they have no cause to be afraid of\\r\\nanimals, are sometimes in situations to be provoked by them; and the\\r\\nnice casuist will find it difficult to do strict justice upon the\\r\\noffended and the offenders.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 2, 1796. S----, nine years old, took care of his brother\\r\\nH----\\'s hot-bed for some time, when H---- was absent from home. He was\\r\\nextremely anxious about his charge; he took one of his sisters to look\\r\\nat the hot-bed, showed her a hole where the mice came in, and\\r\\nexpressed great hatred against the whole race. He the same day asked\\r\\nhis mother for a bait for the mouse-trap; his mother refused to give\\r\\nhim one, telling him that she did not wish he should learn to kill\\r\\nanimals. How good nature sometimes leads to the opposite feeling!\\r\\nS----\\'s love for his brother\\'s cucumbers made him _imagine_ and\\r\\ncompass the death of the mice. Children should be protected against\\r\\nanimals, which we do not wish that they should hate; if cats scratch\\r\\nthem, and dogs bite them, and mice devour the fruits of their\\r\\nindustry, children must consider these animals as enemies; they cannot\\r\\nlove them, and they may learn the habit of revenge, from being exposed\\r\\nto their insults and depredations. Pythagoras himself would have\\r\\ninsisted upon his exclusive right to the vegetables on which he was to\\r\\nsubsist, especially if he had raised them by his own care and\\r\\nindustry. Buffon,[88] notwithstanding all his benevolent philosophy,\\r\\ncan scarcely speak with patience of his enemies the field mice; who,\\r\\nwhen he was trying experiments upon the culture of forest trees,\\r\\ntormented him perpetually by their insatiable love of acorns. \"_I was\\r\\nterrified_,\" says he, \"at the discovery of half a bushel, and often a\\r\\nwhole bushel, of acorns in each of the holes inhabited by these little\\r\\nanimals; they had collected these acorns for their winter provision.\"\\r\\nThe philosopher gave orders immediately for the erection of a great\\r\\nnumber of traps, and snares baited with broiled nuts; in less than\\r\\nthree weeks nearly three hundred field mice were killed _or taken\\r\\nprisoners_. Mankind are obliged to carry on a defensive war with the\\r\\nanimal world. \"Eat or be eaten,\" says Dr. Darwin, is the great law of\\r\\nnature. It is fortunate for us that there are butchers by profession\\r\\nin the world, and rat-catchers, and cats, otherwise our habits of\\r\\nbenevolence and sympathy would be utterly destroyed. Children, though\\r\\nthey must perceive the necessity for destroying certain animals need\\r\\nnot be themselves executioners; they should not conquer the natural\\r\\nrepugnance to the sight of the struggles of pain, and the convulsions\\r\\nof death; their aversion of being the cause of pain should be\\r\\npreserved, both by principle and habit. Those who have not been\\r\\nhabituated to the bloody form of cruelty, can never fix their eye upon\\r\\nher without shuddering; even those to whom she may have, in some\\r\\ninstances, been early familiarized, recoil from her appearance in any\\r\\nshape to which they have not been accustomed. At one of the\\r\\nmagnificent shows with which Pompey[89] entertained the Roman people\\r\\nfor five days successively, the populace enjoyed the death of wild\\r\\nbeasts; five hundred lions were killed; but, on the last day, when\\r\\ntwenty elephants were put to death, the people, unused to the sight,\\r\\nand moved by the lamentable howlings of these animals, were seized\\r\\nwith sudden compassion; they execrated Pompey himself for being the\\r\\nauthor of so much cruelty.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharity for the poor, is often inculcated in books for children; but\\r\\nhow is this virtue to be actually brought into practice in childhood?\\r\\nWithout proper objects of charity are selected by the parents,\\r\\nchildren have no opportunities of discovering them; they have not\\r\\nsufficient knowledge of the world to distinguish truth from falsehood\\r\\nin the complaints of the distressed: nor have they sufficiently\\r\\nenlarged views to discern the best means of doing good to their\\r\\nfellow-creatures. They may give away money to the poor, but they do\\r\\nnot always feel the value of what they give: they give counters:\\r\\nsupplied with all the necessaries and luxuries of life, they have no\\r\\nuse for money; they feel no privation; they make no sacrifice in\\r\\ngiving money away, or at least, none worthy to be extolled as heroic.\\r\\nWhen children grow up, they learn the value of money; their generosity\\r\\nwill then cost them rather more effort, and yet can be rewarded only\\r\\nwith the same expressions of gratitude, with the same blessings from\\r\\nthe beggar, or the same applause from the spectator.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us put charity out of the question, and suppose that the\\r\\ngenerosity of children is displayed in making presents to their\\r\\ncompanions, still there are difficulties. These presents are usually\\r\\nbaubles, which at the best can encourage only a frivolous taste. But\\r\\nwe must further consider, that even generous children are apt to\\r\\nexpect generosity equal to their own from their companions; then come\\r\\ntacit or explicit comparisons of the value or elegance of their\\r\\nrespective gifts; the difficult rules of exchange and barter are to be\\r\\nlearned; and nice calculations of _Tare and Tret_ are entered into by\\r\\nthe repentant borrowers and lenders. A sentimental, two often ends in\\r\\na commercial intercourse; and those who begin with the most munificent\\r\\ndispositions, sometimes end with selfish discontent, low cunning, or\\r\\ndisgusting ostentation. Whoever has carefully attended to young makers\\r\\nof presents, and makers of bargains, will not think this account of\\r\\nthem much exaggerated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then what is to be done? How are the social affections to be\\r\\ndeveloped? How is the sensibility of children to be tried? How is the\\r\\nyoung heart to display its most amiable feelings?\" a sentimental\\r\\npreceptress will impatiently inquire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amiable feelings of the heart need not be displayed; they may be\\r\\nsufficiently exercised without the stimulus either of our eloquence or\\r\\nour applause. In madame de Silleri\\'s account of the education of the\\r\\nchildren of the duke of Orleans, there appears rather too much\\r\\nsentimental artifice and management. When the Duchess of Orleans was\\r\\nill, the children were instructed to write \"charming notes\" from day\\r\\nto day, and from hour to hour, to inquire how she did. Once when a\\r\\nservant was going from Saint Leu to Paris, madame de Silleri asked her\\r\\npupils if they had any commissions; the little duke de Chartres says\\r\\nyes, and gave a message about a bird-cage, but he did not recollect to\\r\\nwrite to his mother, till somebody whispered to him that he had\\r\\nforgotten it. Madame de Silleri calls this childish forgetfulness a\\r\\n\"heinous offence;\" but was not it very natural, that the boy should\\r\\nthink of his bird cage? and what mother would wish that her children\\r\\nshould have it put into their head, to inquire after her health in the\\r\\ncomplimentary style? Another time, madame de Silleri is displeased\\r\\nwith her pupils, because they did not show sufficient sympathy and\\r\\nconcern for her when she had a headache or sore throat. The exact\\r\\nnumber of messages which, consistently with the strict duties of\\r\\nfriendship, they ought to have sent, are upon another occasion\\r\\nprescribed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had yesterday afternoon a violent attack of the colic, and you\\r\\ndiscovered the greatest sensibility. By the journal of M. le Brun, I\\r\\nfind it was the duke de Montpensier who thought this morning of\\r\\nwriting to inquire how I did. You left me yesterday in a very calm\\r\\nstate, and there was no reason for anxiety; but, consistently with the\\r\\nstrict duties of friendship, you ought to have given orders before you\\r\\nwent to bed, for inquiries to be made at eight o\\'clock in the morning,\\r\\nto know whether I had had any return of my complaint during the night;\\r\\nand you should again have sent at ten, to learn from myself, the\\r\\ninstant I awoke, the exact state of my health. Such are the benevolent\\r\\nand tender cares which a lively and sincere friendship dictates. You\\r\\nmust accustom yourselves to the observance of them, if you wish to be\\r\\nbeloved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother day madame de Silleri told the duke de Chartres, that he had a\\r\\nvery idiotic appearance, because, when he went to see his mother, his\\r\\nattention was taken up by two paroquets which happened to be in the\\r\\nroom. All these reproaches and documents could not, we should\\r\\napprehend, tend to increase the real sensibility and affection of\\r\\nchildren. Gratitude is one of the most certain, but one of the latest,\\r\\nrewards, which preceptors and parents should expect from their pupils.\\r\\nThose who are too impatient to wait for the gradual development of the\\r\\naffections, will obtain from their children, instead of warm, genuine,\\r\\nenlightened gratitude, nothing but the expression of cold,\\r\\nconstrained, stupid hypocrisy. During the process of education, a\\r\\nchild cannot perceive its ultimate end; how can he judge whether the\\r\\nmeans employed by his parents, are well adapted to effect their\\r\\npurposes? Moments of restraint and of privation, or, perhaps, of\\r\\npositive pain, must be endured by children under the mildest system of\\r\\neducation: they must, therefore, perceive, that their parents are the\\r\\nimmediate cause of some evils to them; the remote good is beyond their\\r\\nview. And can we expect from an infant the systematic resignation of\\r\\nan optimist? Belief upon trust, is very different from that which\\r\\narises from experience; and no one, who understands the human heart,\\r\\nwill expect incompatible feelings: in the mind of a child, the feeling\\r\\nof present pain is incompatible with gratitude. Mrs. Macaulay mentions\\r\\na striking instance of extorted gratitude. A poor child, who had been\\r\\ntaught to return thanks for every thing, had a bitter medicine given\\r\\nto her; when she had drank it, she curtesied, and said, \"Thank you for\\r\\nmy good stuff.\" There was a mistake in the medicine, and the child\\r\\ndied the next morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren who are not sentimentally educated, often offend by their\\r\\nsimplicity, and frequently disgust people of impatient feelings, by\\r\\ntheir apparent indifference to things which are expected to touch\\r\\ntheir sensibility. Let us be content with nature, or rather let us\\r\\nnever exchange simplicity for affectation. Nothing hurts young people\\r\\nmore than to be watched continually about their feelings, to have\\r\\ntheir countenances scrutinized, and the degrees of their sensibility\\r\\nmeasured by the surveying eye of the unmerciful spectator. Under the\\r\\nconstraint of such examinations, they can think of nothing, but that\\r\\nthey are looked at, and feel nothing but shame or apprehension: they\\r\\nare afraid to lay their minds open, lest they should be convicted of\\r\\nsome deficiency of feeling. On the contrary, children who are not in\\r\\ndread of this sentimental inquisition, speak their minds, the truth,\\r\\nand the whole truth, without effort or disguise: they lay open their\\r\\nhearts, and tell their thoughts as they arise, with simplicity that\\r\\nwould not fear to enter even \"The palace of Truth.\"[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nA little girl, Ho----, who was not quite four years old, asked her\\r\\nmother to give her a plaything: one of her sisters had just before\\r\\nasked for the same thing. \"I cannot give it to you both,\" said the\\r\\nmother.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Ho----._ No, but I wish you to give it to me, and not to E----.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Mother._ Don\\'t you wish your sister to have what she wants?\\r\\n\\r\\n_Ho----._ Mother, if I say that I _don\\'t_ wish so, will you give it to\\r\\nme?\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps this _naivete_ might have displeased some scrupulous admirers\\r\\nof politeness, who could not discover in it symptoms of that\\r\\nindependent simplicity of character, for which the child who made this\\r\\nspeech was distinguished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you _always_ love me?\" said a mother to her son, who was about\\r\\nfour years old.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Always,\" said the child, \"except when I am asleep.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Mother._ \"And why do you not love me when you are asleep?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Son._ \"Because I do not think of you then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sensible answer showed, that the boy reflected accurately upon\\r\\nhis own feelings, and a judicious parent must consequently have a\\r\\nsober certainty of his affection. The thoughtless caresses of\\r\\nchildren who are never accustomed to reason, are lavished alike upon\\r\\nstrangers and friends, and their fondness of to-day may, without any\\r\\nreasonable cause, become aversion by to-morrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren are often asked to tell which of their friends they love the\\r\\nbest, but they are seldom required to assign any reason for their\\r\\nchoice. It is not prudent to question them frequently about their own\\r\\nfeelings; but whenever they express any decided preference, we should\\r\\nendeavour to _lead_, not to _drive_ them to reflect upon the reasons\\r\\nfor their affection. They will probably at first mention some\\r\\nparticular instance of kindness, which they have lately received from\\r\\nthe person whom they prefer. \"I like such a person because he mended\\r\\nmy top.\" \"I like such another because he took me out to walk with him\\r\\nand let me gather flowers.\" By degrees we may teach children to\\r\\ngeneralize their ideas, and to perceive that they like people for\\r\\nbeing either useful or agreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe desire to return kindness by kindness, arises very early in the\\r\\nmind; and the hope of conciliating the good will of the powerful\\r\\nbeings by whom they are surrounded, is one of the first wishes that\\r\\nappears in the minds of intelligent and affectionate children. From\\r\\nthis sense of mutual dependence, the first principles of social\\r\\nintercourse are deduced, and we may render our pupils either mean\\r\\nsycophants, or useful and honourable members of society, by the\\r\\nmethods which we use to direct their first efforts to please. It\\r\\nshould be our object to convince them, that the exchange of mutual\\r\\ngood offices contributes to happiness; and whilst we connect the\\r\\ndesire to assist others with the perception of the beneficial\\r\\nconsequences that eventually arise to themselves, we may be certain\\r\\nthat children will never become blindly selfish, or idly sentimental.\\r\\nWe cannot help admiring the simplicity, strength of mind, and good\\r\\nsense, of a little girl of four years old, who, when she was put into\\r\\na stage coach with a number of strangers, looked round upon them all,\\r\\nand, after a few minutes silence, addressed them, with the imperfect\\r\\narticulation of infancy, in the following words:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you\\'ll be good to me, I\\'ll be good to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst we were writing upon sympathy and sensibility, we met with the\\r\\nfollowing apposite passage:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In 1765, I was,\" says M. de St. Pierre, \"at Dresden, at a play acted\\r\\nat court; it was the Pere de Famille. The electoress came in with one\\r\\nof her daughters, who might be about five or six years old. An officer\\r\\nof the Saxon guards, who came with me to the play, whispered, \\'That\\r\\nchild will interest you as much as the play.\\' As soon as she was\\r\\nseated, she placed both her hands on the front of the box, fixed her\\r\\neyes upon the stage, and continued with her mouth open, all attention\\r\\nto the motions of the actors. It was truly touching to see their\\r\\ndifferent passions painted on her face as in a glass. There appeared\\r\\nin her countenance successively, anxiety, surprise, melancholy, and\\r\\ngrief; at length the interest increasing in every scene, tears began\\r\\nto flow, which soon ran in abundance down her little cheeks; then came\\r\\nagitation, sighs, and loud sobs; at last they were obliged to carry\\r\\nher out of the box, lest she should choke herself with crying. My next\\r\\nneighbour told me, that every time that this young princess came to a\\r\\npathetic play, she was obliged to leave the house before the\\r\\ncatastrophe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have seen,\" continues M. de St. Pierre, \"instances of sensibility\\r\\nstill more touching amongst the children of the common people, because\\r\\nthe emotion was not here produced by any theatrical effect. As I was\\r\\nwalking some years ago in the Pre St. Gervais, at the beginning of\\r\\nwinter, I saw a poor woman lying on the ground, busied in weeding a\\r\\nbed of sorrel; near her was a little girl of six years old at the\\r\\nutmost, standing motionless, and all purple with cold. I addressed\\r\\nmyself to this woman, who appeared to be ill, and I asked her what was\\r\\nthe matter with her. Sir, said she, for these three months I have\\r\\nsuffered terribly from the rheumatism, but my illness troubles me less\\r\\nthan this child, she never will leave me; if I say to her, Thou art\\r\\nquite frozen, go and warm thyself in the house, she answers me, Alas!\\r\\nmamma, if I leave you, you\\'ll certainly fall ill again!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another time, being at Marly, I went to see, in the groves of that\\r\\nmagnificent park, that charming group of children who are feeding with\\r\\nvine leaves and grapes a goat who seems to be playing with them. Near\\r\\nthis spot is an open summer house, where Louis XV. on fine days, used\\r\\nsometimes to take refreshment. As it was showery weather, I went to\\r\\ntake shelter for a few minutes. I found there three children, who were\\r\\nmuch more interesting than children of marble. They were two little\\r\\ngirls, very pretty, and very busily employed in picking up all round\\r\\nthe summer house dry sticks, which they put into a sort of wallet\\r\\nwhich was lying upon the king\\'s table, whilst a little ill clothed\\r\\nthin boy was devouring a bit of bread in one corner of the room. I\\r\\nasked the tallest of the children, who appeared to be between eight\\r\\nand nine years old, what she meant to do with the wood which she was\\r\\ngathering together with so much eagerness. She answered, \\'Sir, you see\\r\\nthat little boy, he is very unhappy. He has a mother-in-law\\' (Why\\r\\nalways _a mother-in-law_?) \\'He has a mother-in-law, who sends him all\\r\\nday long to look for wood; when he does not bring any home, he is\\r\\nbeaten; when he has got any, the Swiss who stands at the entrance of\\r\\nthe park takes it all away from him, and keeps it for himself. The boy\\r\\nis almost starved with hunger, and we have given him our breakfast.\\'\\r\\nAfter having said these words, she and her companion finished filling\\r\\nthe little wallet, they packed it upon the boy\\'s shoulders, and they\\r\\nran before their unfortunate friend to see that he might pass in\\r\\nsafety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have read these three anecdotes to several children, and have found\\r\\nthat the _active_ friends of the little wood-cutter were the most\\r\\nadmired. It is probable, that amongst children who have been much\\r\\npraised for expressions of sensibility, the young lady who wept so\\r\\nbitterly at the play-house, would be preferred; affectionate children\\r\\nwill like the little girl who stood purple with cold beside her sick\\r\\nmother; but if they have been well educated, they will probably\\r\\nexpress some surprise at her motionless attitude; they will ask why\\r\\nshe did not try to help her mother to weed the bed of sorrel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt requires much skill and delicacy in our conduct towards children,\\r\\nto preserve a proper medium between the indulging and the repressing\\r\\nof their sensibility. We are cruel towards them when we suspect their\\r\\ngenuine expressions of affection; nothing hurts the temper of a\\r\\ngenerous child more than this species of injustice. Receive his\\r\\nexpressions of kindness and gratitude with cold reserve, or a look\\r\\nthat implies a doubt of his truth, and you give him so much pain, that\\r\\nyou not only repress, but destroy his affectionate feelings. On the\\r\\ncontrary, if you appear touched and delighted by his caresses, from\\r\\nthe hope of pleasing, he will be naturally inclined to repeat such\\r\\ndemonstrations of sensibility: this repetition should be gently\\r\\ndiscouraged, lest it should lead to affectation. At the same time,\\r\\nthough we take this precaution, we should consider, that children are\\r\\nnot early sensible that affectation is either ridiculous or\\r\\ndisgusting; they are not conscious of doing any thing wrong by\\r\\nrepeating what they have once perceived to be agreeable in their own,\\r\\nor in the manners of others. They frequently imitate, without any idea\\r\\nthat imitation is displeasing; their object, as Locke observes, is to\\r\\nplease by affectation; they only mistake the means: we should rectify\\r\\nthis mistake without treating it as a crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little girl of five years old stood beside her mother, observing the\\r\\ndistribution of a dish of strawberries, the first strawberries of the\\r\\nyear; and seeing a number of people busily helping, and being helped\\r\\nto cream and sugar, said in a low voice, not meant to attract\\r\\nattention, \"I like to see people helping one another.\" Had the child,\\r\\nat this instant, been praised for this natural expression of sympathy,\\r\\nthe pleasure of praise would have been immediately substituted in her\\r\\nmind, instead of the feeling of benevolence, which was in itself\\r\\nsufficiently agreeable; and, perhaps, from a desire to please, she\\r\\nwould, upon the next favourable occasion, have repeated the same\\r\\nsentiment; this we should immediately call affectation; but how could\\r\\nthe child foresee, that the repetition of what we formerly liked,\\r\\nwould be offensive? We should not first extol sympathy, and then\\r\\ndisdain affectation; our encomiums frequently produce the faults by\\r\\nwhich we are disgusted. Sensibility and sympathy, when they have\\r\\nproper objects, and full employment, do not look for applause; they\\r\\nare sufficiently happy in their own enjoyments. Those who have\\r\\nattempted to teach children, must have observed, that sympathy is\\r\\nimmediately connected with all the imitative arts; the nature of this\\r\\nconnection, more especially in poetry and painting, has been pointed\\r\\nout with ingenuity and eloquence by those[91] whose excellence in\\r\\nthese arts entitle their theories to our prudent attention. We shall\\r\\nnot attempt to repeat; we refer to their observations. Sufficient\\r\\noccupation for sympathy, may be found by cultivating the talents of\\r\\nyoung people.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout repeating here what has been said in many other places, it may\\r\\nbe necessary to remind all who are concerned in _female_ education,\\r\\nthat peculiar caution is necessary to manage female sensibility: to\\r\\nmake, what is called the heart, a source of permanent pleasure, we\\r\\nmust cultivate the reasoning powers at the same time that we repress\\r\\nthe enthusiasm of _fine feeling_. Women, from their situation and\\r\\nduties in society, are called upon rather for the daily exercise of\\r\\nquiet domestic virtues, than for those splendid acts of generosity,\\r\\nor those exaggerated expressions of tenderness, which are the\\r\\ncharacteristics of heroines in romance. Sentimental authors, who paint\\r\\nwith enchanting colours all the graces and all the virtues in happy\\r\\nunion, teach us to expect that this union should be indissoluble.\\r\\nAfterwards, from the natural influence of association, we expect in\\r\\nreal life to meet with virtue when we see grace, and we are\\r\\ndisappointed, almost disgusted, when we find virtue unadorned. This\\r\\nfalse association has a double effect upon the conduct of women; it\\r\\nprepares them to be pleased, and it excites them to endeavour to\\r\\nplease by adventitious charms, rather than by those qualities which\\r\\nmerit esteem. Women, who have been much addicted to common\\r\\nnovel-reading, are always acting in imitation of some Jemima, or\\r\\nAlmeria, who never existed, and they perpetually mistake plain William\\r\\nand Thomas for \"_My Beverly!_\" They have another peculiar misfortune;\\r\\nthey require continual great emotions to keep them in tolerable humour\\r\\nwith themselves; they must have tears in their eyes, or they are\\r\\napprehensive that their hearts are growing hard. They have accustomed\\r\\nthemselves to such violent stimulus, that they cannot endure the\\r\\nlanguor to which they are subject in the intervals of delirium. Pink\\r\\nappears pale to the eye that is used to scarlet; and common food is\\r\\ninsipid to the taste which has been vitiated by the high seasonings of\\r\\nart.\\r\\n\\r\\nA celebrated French actress, in the wane of her charms, and who, for\\r\\nthat reason, began to feel weary of the world, exclaimed, whilst she\\r\\nwas recounting what she had suffered from a faithless lover, \"Ah!\\r\\nc\\'\\xc3\\xa9toit le bon temps, j\\'\\xc3\\xa9tois bien malheureuse!\"[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe happy age in which women can, with any grace or effect, be\\r\\nromantically wretched, is, even with the beautiful, but a short season\\r\\nof felicity. The sentimental sorrows of any female mourner, of more\\r\\nthan thirty years standing, command but little sympathy, and less\\r\\nadmiration; and what other consolations are suited to sentimental\\r\\nsorrows?\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen, who cultivate their reasoning powers, and who acquire tastes\\r\\nfor science and literature, find sufficient variety in life, and do\\r\\nnot require the _stimulus_ of dissipation, or of romance. Their\\r\\nsympathy and sensibility are engrossed by proper objects, and\\r\\nconnected with habits of useful exertion: they usually feel the\\r\\naffection which others profess, and actually enjoy the happiness which\\r\\nothers describe.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[78] Adam Smith.\\r\\n\\r\\n[79] See Smith.\\r\\n\\r\\n[80] Edward.\\r\\n\\r\\n[81] V.

No great subtilty of distinction is requisite to\\r\\nmark the differences between Vanity and Pride, since those differences\\r\\nhave been pointed out by every moralist, who has hoped to please\\r\\nmankind by an accurate delineation of the failings of human nature.\\r\\nWhatever distinctions exist, or may be supposed to exist, between the\\r\\ncharacters in which pride or vanity predominates, it will readily be\\r\\nallowed, that there is one thing in which they both agree--they both\\r\\nreceive pleasure from the approbation of others, and from their own.\\r\\nWe are disgusted with the vain man, when he intemperately indulges in\\r\\npraise of himself, however justly he may be entitled to that praise,\\r\\nbecause he offends against those manners which we have been accustomed\\r\\nto think polite, and he claims from us a greater portion of sympathy\\r\\nthan we can possibly afford to give him. We are not, however, pleased\\r\\nby the negligence with which the proud man treats us; we do not like\\r\\nto see that he can exist in independent happiness, satisfied with a\\r\\ncool internal sense of his own merits; he loses our sympathy, because\\r\\nhe does not appear to value it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we could give our pupils exactly the character we wish, what\\r\\ndegrees of vanity and pride should we desire them to have, and how\\r\\nshould we regulate these passions? Should we not desire, that their\\r\\nambition to excel might be sufficient to produce the greatest possible\\r\\nexertions, directed to the best possible objects; that their opinion\\r\\nof themselves should be strictly just, and should never be expressed\\r\\nin such a manner as to offend against propriety, or so as to forfeit\\r\\nthe sympathy of mankind? As to the degree of pleasure which they\\r\\nshould feel from their secret reflections upon their own meritorious\\r\\nconduct, we should certainly desire this to be as lasting, and as\\r\\nexquisite, as possible. A considerable portion of the happiness of\\r\\nlife arises from the sense of self-approbation; we should, therefore,\\r\\nsecure this gratification in its utmost perfection. We must observe,\\r\\nthat, however independent the proud man imagines himself to be of the\\r\\nopinions of all around him, he must form his judgment of his own\\r\\nmerits from some standard of comparison, by some laws drawn from\\r\\nobservation of what mankind in general, or those whom he particularly\\r\\nesteems, think wise or amiable. He must begin then in the same manner\\r\\nwith the vain man, whom he despises, by collecting the suffrages of\\r\\nothers; if he selects, with perfect wisdom, the opinions which are\\r\\nmost just, he forms his character upon excellent principles; and the\\r\\nmore steadily he abides by his first views, the more he commands and\\r\\nobtains respect. But if, unfortunately, he makes a mistake at first,\\r\\nhis obstinacy in errour is not to be easily corrected, for he is not\\r\\naffected by the general voice of disapprobation, nor by the partial\\r\\nloss of the common pleasures of sympathy. The vain man, on the\\r\\ncontrary, is in danger, let him form his first notions of right and\\r\\nwrong ever so justly, of changing them when he happens to be in\\r\\nsociety with any persons who do not agree with him in their moral\\r\\nopinions, or who refuse him that applause which supports his own\\r\\nfeeble self-approbation. We must, in education, endeavour to guard\\r\\nagainst these opposite dangers; we must enlighten the understanding,\\r\\nto give our pupils the power of forming their rules of conduct\\r\\nrightly, and we must give them sufficient strength of mind to abide by\\r\\nthe principles which they have formed. When we first praise children,\\r\\nwe must be careful to associate pleasure with those things which are\\r\\nreally deserving of approbation. If we praise them for beauty, or for\\r\\nany happy expressions which entertain us, but which entertain us\\r\\nmerely as the sprightly nonsense of childhood, we create vanity in the\\r\\nminds of our pupils; we give them false ideas of merit, and, if we\\r\\nexcite them to exertions, they are not exertions directed to any\\r\\nvaluable objects. Praise is a strong stimulus to industry, if it be\\r\\nproperly managed; but if we give it in too large and lavish quantities\\r\\nearly in life, we shall soon find that it loses its effect, and yet\\r\\nthat the _patient_ languishes for want of the excitation which custom\\r\\nhas rendered almost essential to his existence. We say the _patient_,\\r\\nfor this mental languor may be considered entirely as a disease. For\\r\\nits cure, see the second volume of Zoonomia, under the article Vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren, who are habituated to the daily and hourly food of praise,\\r\\ncontinually require this sustenance unless they are attended to; but\\r\\nwe may gradually break bad habits. It is said, that some animals can\\r\\nsupply themselves at a single draught with what will quench their\\r\\nthirst for many days. The human animal may, perhaps, by education, be\\r\\ntaught similar foresight and abstinence in the management of his\\r\\nthirst for flattery. Young people, who live with persons that seldom\\r\\nbestow praise, do not expect that stimulus, and they are content if\\r\\nthey discover by certain signs, either in the countenance, manner, or\\r\\ntone of voice, of those whom they wish to please, that they are\\r\\ntolerably well satisfied. It is of little consequence by what language\\r\\napprobation is conveyed, whether by words, or looks, or by that\\r\\nsilence which speaks with so much eloquence; but it is of great\\r\\nimportance that our pupils should set a high value upon the\\r\\nexpressions of our approbation. They will value it in proportion to\\r\\ntheir esteem and their affection for us; we include in the word\\r\\n_esteem_, a belief in our justice, and in our discernment. Expressions\\r\\nof affection, associated with praise, not only increase the pleasure,\\r\\nbut they alter the nature the of that pleasure; and if they gratify\\r\\nvanity, they at the same time excite some of the best feelings of the\\r\\nheart. The selfishness of vanity is corrected by this association; and\\r\\nthe two pleasures of sympathy and self-complacency should never, when\\r\\nwe can avoid it, be separated.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren, who are well educated, and who have acquired an habitual\\r\\ndesire for the approbation of their friends, may continue absolutely\\r\\nindifferent to the praise of strangers, or of _common_ acquaintance;\\r\\nnor is it probable that this indifference should suddenly be\\r\\nconquered, because the greatest part of the pleasure of praise in\\r\\ntheir mind, depends upon the esteem and affection which they feel for\\r\\nthe persons by whom it is bestowed. Instead of desiring that our\\r\\npupils should entirely repress, in the company of their own family,\\r\\nthe pleasure which they feel from the praise that is given to them by\\r\\ntheir friends, we should rather indulge them in this natural expansion\\r\\nof mind; we should rather permit their youthful vanity to display\\r\\nitself openly to those whom they most love and esteem, than drive\\r\\nthem, by unreasonable severity, and a cold refusal of sympathy, into\\r\\nthe society of less rigid observers. Those who have an aversion to\\r\\nvanity, will not easily bear with its uncultivated intemperance of\\r\\ntongue; but they should consider, that much of what disgusts them, is\\r\\nowing to the simplicity of childhood, which must be allowed time to\\r\\nlearn that respect for the feelings of others, which teaches us to\\r\\nrestrain our own: but we must not be in haste to restrain, lest we\\r\\nteach hypocrisy, instead of strength of mind, or real humility. If we\\r\\nexpect that children should excel, and should not know that they\\r\\nexcel, we expect impossibilities; we expect at the same time,\\r\\nintelligence and stupidity. If we desire that they should be excited\\r\\nby praise, and that, at the same time, they should feel no pleasure in\\r\\nthe applause which they have earned, we desire things that are\\r\\nincompatible. If we encourage children to be frank and sincere, and\\r\\nyet, at the same time, reprove them whenever they naturally express\\r\\ntheir opinions of themselves, or the pleasurable feelings of\\r\\nself-approbation, we shall counteract our own wishes. Instead of\\r\\nhastily blaming children for the sincere and simple expression of\\r\\ntheir self-complacency, or of their desire for the approbation of\\r\\nothers, we should gradually point out to them the truth--that those\\r\\nwho refrain from that display of their own perfections which we call\\r\\nvanity, in fact are well repaid for the constraint which they put upon\\r\\nthemselves, by the superior degree of respect and sympathy which they\\r\\nobtain; that vain people effectually counteract their own wishes, and\\r\\nmeet with contempt, instead of admiration. By appealing constantly,\\r\\nwhen we praise, to the judgment of the pupils themselves, we shall at\\r\\nonce teach them the habit of re-judging flattery, and substitute, by\\r\\ninsensible degrees, patient, steady confidence in themselves, for the\\r\\nwavering, weak, impatience of vanity. In proportion as any one\\'s\\r\\nconfidence in himself increases, his anxiety for the applause of\\r\\nothers diminishes: people are very seldom vain of any accomplishments\\r\\nin which they obviously excel, but they frequently continue to be vain\\r\\nof those which are doubtful. Where mankind have not confirmed their\\r\\nown judgment, they are restless, and continually aim either at\\r\\nconvincing others, or themselves, that they are in the right. Hogarth,\\r\\nwho invented a new and original manner of satirizing the follies of\\r\\nmankind, was not vain of this talent, but was extremely vain of his\\r\\nhistorical paintings, which were indifferent performances. Men of\\r\\nacknowledged literary talents, are seldom fond of amateurs; but, if\\r\\nthey are but half satisfied of their own superiority, they collect the\\r\\ntribute of applause with avidity, and without discrimination or\\r\\ndelicacy. Voltaire has been reproached with treating strangers rudely\\r\\nwho went to Ferney, to see and admire a philosopher as a prodigy.\\r\\nVoltaire valued his time more than he did this vulgar admiration; his\\r\\nvisiters, whose understanding had not gone through exactly the same\\r\\nprocess, who had not, probably, been satisfied with public applause,\\r\\nand who set, perhaps, a considerable value upon their own praise,\\r\\ncould not comprehend this appearance of indifference to admiration in\\r\\nVoltaire, especially when it was well known that he was not insensible\\r\\nof fame. He was, at an advanced age, exquisitely anxious about the\\r\\nfate of one of his tragedies; and a public coronation at the theatre\\r\\nat Paris, had power to inebriate him at eighty-four. Those who have\\r\\nexhausted the stimulus of wine, may yet be intoxicated by opium. The\\r\\nvoice of numbers appears to be sometimes necessary to give delight to\\r\\nthose who have been fatigued with the praise of individuals; but this\\r\\ntaste for _acclamation_ is extremely dangerous. A multitude of good\\r\\njudges seldom meet together.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy a slight difference in their manner of reasoning, two men of\\r\\nabilities, who set out with the same desire for fame, may acquire\\r\\ndifferent habits of pride, or of vanity; the one may value the number,\\r\\nthe other may appreciate the judgment of his admirers. There is\\r\\nsomething not only more wise, but more elevated, in this latter\\r\\nspecies of select triumph; the noise is not so great; the music is\\r\\nbetter. \"If I listened to the music of praise,\" says an historian, who\\r\\nobviously was not insensible to its charms, \"I was more seriously\\r\\nsatisfied with the approbation of my _judges_. The candour of Dr.\\r\\nRobertson embraced his disciple. A letter from Mr. Hume overpaid the\\r\\nlabour of ten years.\"[93] Surely no one can be displeased with this\\r\\nlast generous expression of enthusiasm; we are not so well satisfied\\r\\nwith Buffon, when he ostentatiously displays the epistles of a prince\\r\\nand an empress.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps, by pointing out at proper opportunities the difference in our\\r\\nfeelings with respect to vulgar and refined vanity, we might make a\\r\\nuseful impression upon those who have yet their habits to form. The\\r\\nconversion of vanity into pride, is not so difficult a process as\\r\\nthose, who have not analyzed both, might, from the striking difference\\r\\nof their appearance, imagine. By the opposite tendencies of education,\\r\\nopposite characters from the same original dispositions are produced.\\r\\nCicero, had he been early taught to despise the applause of the\\r\\nmultitude, would have turned away like the proud philosopher, who\\r\\nasked his friends what absurdity he had uttered, when he heard the\\r\\npopulace loud in acclamations of his speech; and the cynic, whose\\r\\nvanity was seen through the holes in his cloak, might, perhaps, by a\\r\\nslight difference in his education, have been rendered ambitious of\\r\\nthe Macedonian purple.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn attempting to convert vanity into pride, we must begin by\\r\\nexercising the vain patient in forbearance of present pleasure; it is\\r\\nnot enough to convince his understanding, that the advantages of proud\\r\\nhumility are great; he may be perfectly sensible of this, and may yet\\r\\nhave so little command over himself, that his loquacious vanity may\\r\\nget the better, from hour to hour, of his better judgment. Habits are\\r\\nnot to be instantaneously conquered by reason; if we do not keep this\\r\\nfact in our remembrance, we shall be frequently disappointed in\\r\\neducation; and we shall, perhaps, end by thinking that reason can do\\r\\nnothing, if we begin by thinking that she can do every thing. We must\\r\\nnot expect that a vain child should suddenly break and forget all his\\r\\npast associations; but we may, by a little early attention, prevent\\r\\nmuch of the trouble of curing, or converting, the disease of vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen children first begin to learn accomplishments, or to apply\\r\\nthemselves to literature, those who instruct, are apt to encourage\\r\\nthem with too large a portion of praise; _the smallest quantity of\\r\\nstimulus that can produce the exertion we desire, should be used_; if\\r\\nwe use more, we waste our power, and injure our pupil. As soon as\\r\\nhabit has made any exertion familiar, and consequently easy, we may\\r\\nwithdraw the original excitation, and the exertion will still\\r\\ncontinue. In learning, for instance, a new language, at first, whilst\\r\\nthe pupil is in the midst of the difficulties of regular and irregular\\r\\nverbs, and when, in translation, a dictionary is wanted at every\\r\\nmoment, the occupation itself cannot be very agreeable; but we are\\r\\nexcited by the hope that our labour will every day diminish, and that\\r\\nwe shall at last enjoy the entertainment of reading useful and\\r\\nagreeable books. Children, who have not learnt by experience the\\r\\npleasures of literature, cannot feel this hope as strongly as we do,\\r\\nwe, therefore, excite them by praise; but by degrees they begin to\\r\\nfeel the pleasure of success and occupation; when these are felt, we\\r\\nmay and ought to withdraw the unnecessary excitements of praise. If we\\r\\ncontinue, we mislead the child\\'s mind, and, whilst we deprive him of\\r\\nhis natural reward, we give him a factitious taste. When any moral\\r\\nhabit is to be acquired, or when we wish that our pupil should cure\\r\\nhimself of any fault, we must employ at first strong excitement, and\\r\\nreward with warmth and eloquence of approbation; when the fault is\\r\\nconquered, when the virtue is acquired, the extraordinary excitement\\r\\nshould be withdrawn, and all this should not be done with an air of\\r\\nmystery and artifice; the child should know all that we do, and why\\r\\nwe do it; the sooner he learns how his own mind is managed, the\\r\\nbetter--the sooner he will assist in his own education.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery body must have observed, that languor of mind succeeds to the\\r\\nintoxication of vanity; if we can avoid the intoxication, we shall\\r\\navoid the languor. Common sayings often imply those sensible\\r\\nobservations which philosophers, when they theorize only, express in\\r\\nother words. We frequently hear it said to a child, \"Praise spoils\\r\\nyou; my praise did you harm; you can\\'t bear praise well; you grow\\r\\nconceited; you become idle; you are good for nothing, because you have\\r\\nbeen too much flattered.\" All these expressions show, that the\\r\\nconsequences of over-stimulating the mind by praise, have been vaguely\\r\\ntaken notice of in education; but no general rules have been deduced\\r\\nfrom these observations. With children of different habits and\\r\\ntemperaments, the same degree of excitement acts differently, so that\\r\\nit is scarcely possible to fix upon any positive quantity fit for all\\r\\ndispositions--the quantity must be relative; but we may, perhaps, fix\\r\\nupon a criterion by which, in most cases, the proportion may be\\r\\nascertained. The golden rule,[95] which an eminent physician has given\\r\\nto the medical world for ascertaining the necessary and useful\\r\\nquantity of stimulus for weak and feverish patients, may, with\\r\\nadvantage, be applied in education. Whenever praise produces the\\r\\nintoxication of vanity, it is hurtful; whenever the appearances of\\r\\nvanity diminish in consequence of praise, we may be satisfied that it\\r\\ndoes good, that it increases the pupil\\'s confidence in himself, and\\r\\nhis strength of mind. We repeat, that persons who have confidence in\\r\\nthemselves, may be proud, but are never vain; that vanity cannot\\r\\nsupport herself without the concurring flattery of others; pride is\\r\\nsatisfied with his own approbation. In the education of children who\\r\\nare more inclined to pride than to vanity, we must present large\\r\\nobjects to the understanding, and large motives must be used to excite\\r\\nvoluntary exertion. If the understanding of proud people be not early\\r\\ncultivated, they frequently fix upon some false ideas of honour or\\r\\ndignity, to which they are resolute martyrs through life. Thus the\\r\\nhigh-born Spaniards, if we may be allowed to reason from the imperfect\\r\\nhistory of national character. The Spaniards, who associate the ideas\\r\\nof dignity and indolence, would rather submit to the evils of poverty,\\r\\nthan to the imaginary disgrace of working for their bread. Volney, and\\r\\nthe baron de Tott, give us some curious instances of the pride of the\\r\\nTurks, which prevents them from being taught any useful arts by\\r\\nforeigners. To show how early false associations are formed and\\r\\nsupported by pride, we need but recollect the anecdote of the child\\r\\nmentioned by de Tott.[96] The baron de Tott bought a pretty toy for a\\r\\npresent for a little Turkish friend, but the child was too proud to\\r\\nseem pleased with the toy; the child\\'s grandfather came into the room,\\r\\nsaw, and was delighted with the toy, sat down on the carpet, and\\r\\nplayed with it until he broke it. We like the second childhood of the\\r\\ngrandfather better than the premature old age of the grandson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe self-command which the fear of disgrace insures, can produce\\r\\neither great virtues, or great vices. Revenge and generosity are, it\\r\\nis said, to be found in their highest state amongst nations and\\r\\nindividuals characterized by pride. The early objects which are\\r\\nassociated with the idea of honour in the mind, are of great\\r\\nconsequence; but it is of yet more consequence to teach proud minds\\r\\nearly to bend to the power of reason, or rather to glory in being\\r\\ngoverned by reason. They should be instructed, that the only possible\\r\\nmeans of maintaining their opinions amongst persons of sense, is to\\r\\nsupport them by unanswerable arguments. They should be taught, that,\\r\\nto secure respect, they must deserve it; and their self-denial, or\\r\\nself-command, should never obtain that tacit admiration which they\\r\\nmost value, except where it is exerted for useful and rational\\r\\npurposes. The constant custom of appealing, in the last resort, to\\r\\ntheir own judgment, which distinguishes the proud from the vain, makes\\r\\nit peculiarly necessary that the judgment, to which so much is\\r\\ntrusted, should be highly cultivated. A vain man may be tolerably well\\r\\nconducted in life by a sensible friend; a proud man ought to be able\\r\\nto conduct himself perfectly well, because he will not accept of any\\r\\nassistance. It seems that some proud people confine their benevolent\\r\\nvirtues within a smaller sphere than others; they value only their own\\r\\nrelations, their friends, their country, or whatever is connected with\\r\\nthemselves. This species of pride may be corrected by the same means\\r\\nwhich are used to increase sympathy.[97] Those who, either from\\r\\ntemperament, example, or accidental circumstances, have acquired the\\r\\nhabit of repressing and commanding their emotions, must be carefully\\r\\ndistinguished from the selfish and insensible. In the present times,\\r\\nwhen the affectation of sensibility is to be dreaded, we should rather\\r\\nencourage that species of pride which disdains to display the\\r\\naffections of the heart. \"You Romans triumph over your tears, and call\\r\\nit virtue! I triumph in my tears,\" says Caractacus; his tears were\\r\\nrespectable, but in general the Roman triumph would command the most\\r\\nsympathy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people attribute to pride all expressions of confidence in one\\'s\\r\\nself: these may be offensive to common society, but they are sometimes\\r\\npowerful over the human mind, and where they are genuine, mark\\r\\nsomewhat superior in character. Much of the effect of lord Chatham\\'s\\r\\neloquence, much of his transcendent influence in public, must be\\r\\nattributed to the confidence which he showed in his own superiority.\\r\\n\"I trample upon impossibilities!\" was an exclamation which no\\r\\ninferiour mind would dare to make. Would the house of commons have\\r\\npermitted any one but lord Chatham to have answered an oration by\\r\\n\"Tell me, gentle shepherd, where?\" The danger of failing, the hazard\\r\\nthat he runs of becoming ridiculous who verges upon the moral sublime,\\r\\nis taken into our account when we judge of the action, and we pay\\r\\ninvoluntary tribute to courage and success: but how miserable is the\\r\\nfate of the man who mistakes his own powers, and upon trial is unable\\r\\nto support his assumed superiority; mankind revenge themselves without\\r\\nmercy upon his ridiculous pride, eager to teach him the difference\\r\\nbetween insolence and magnanimity. Young people inclined to over-rate\\r\\ntheir own talents, or to under-value the abilities of others, should\\r\\nfrequently have instances given to them from real life, of the\\r\\nmortifications and disgrace to which imprudent boasters expose\\r\\nthemselves. Where they are able to demonstrate their own abilities,\\r\\nthey run no risk in speaking with decent confidence; but where their\\r\\nsuccess depends, in any degree, either upon fortune or opinion, they\\r\\nshould never run the hazard of presumption. Modesty prepossesses\\r\\nmankind in favour of its possessor, and has the advantage of being\\r\\nboth graceful and safe: this was perfectly understood by the crafty\\r\\nUlysses, who neither raised his eyes, nor stretched his sceptered\\r\\nhand, \"when he first rose to speak.\" We do not, however, recommend\\r\\nthis artificial modesty; its trick is soon discovered, and its\\r\\nsameness of dissimulation presently disgusts. Prudence should prevent\\r\\nyoung people from hazardous boasting; and good nature and good sense,\\r\\nwhich constitute real politeness, will restrain them from obtruding\\r\\ntheir merits to the mortification of their companions: but we do not\\r\\nexpect from them total ignorance of their own comparative merit. The\\r\\naffectation of humility, when carried to the extreme, to which all\\r\\naffectation is liable to be carried, appears full as ridiculous as\\r\\ntroublesome, and offensive as any of the graces of vanity, or the airs\\r\\nof pride. Young people are cured of presumption by mixing with\\r\\nsociety, but they are not so easily cured of any species of\\r\\naffectation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the chapter on female accomplishments, we have endeavoured to point\\r\\nout, that the enlargement of understanding in the fair sex, which must\\r\\nresult from their increasing knowledge, will necessarily correct the\\r\\nfeminine foibles of vanity and affectation.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrong, prophetic, eloquent praise, like that which the great lord\\r\\nChatham bestowed on his son, would rather inspire in a generous soul\\r\\nnoble emulation, than paltry vanity. \"On this boy,\" said he, laying\\r\\nhis hand upon his son\\'s head, \"descends my mantle, with a double\\r\\nportion of my spirit!\" Phillip\\'s praise of his son Alexander, when the\\r\\nboy rode the unmanageable horse,[98] is another instance of the kind\\r\\nof praise capable of exciting ambition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to ambition, we must decide what species of ambition we mean,\\r\\nbefore we can determine whether it ought to be encouraged or\\r\\nrepressed; whether it should be classed amongst virtues or vices; that\\r\\nis to say, whether it adds to the happiness or the misery of human\\r\\ncreatures. \"The inordinate desire of fame,\" which often destroys the\\r\\nlives of millions when it is connected with ideas of military\\r\\nenthusiasm, is justly classed amongst the \"_diseases of volition_:\"\\r\\nfor its description and cure we refer to Zoonomia, vol. ii. Achilles\\r\\nwill there appear to his admirers, perhaps, in a new light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ambition to rise in the world, usually implies a mean, sordid\\r\\ndesire of riches, or what are called honours, to be obtained by the\\r\\ncommon arts of political intrigue, by cabal to win popular favour, or\\r\\nby address to conciliate the patronage of the great. The experience of\\r\\nthose who have been governed during their lives by this passion, if\\r\\npassion it may be called, does not show that it can confer much\\r\\nhappiness either in the pursuit or attainment of its objects. See Bubb\\r\\nDoddington\\'s Diary, a most useful book; a journal of the petty\\r\\nanxieties, and constant dependence, to which an ambitious courtier is\\r\\nnecessarily subjected. See also Mirabeau\\'s \"Secret History of the\\r\\nCourt of Berlin,\" for a picture of a man of great abilities degraded\\r\\nby the same species of low unprincipled competition. We may find in\\r\\nthese books, it is to be hoped, examples which will strike young and\\r\\ngenerous minds, and which may inspire them with contempt for the\\r\\nobjects and the means of vulgar ambition. There is a more noble\\r\\nambition, by which the enthusiastic youth, perfect in the theory of\\r\\nall the virtues, and warm with yet unextinguished benevolence, is apt\\r\\nto be seized; his heart beats with the hope of immortalizing himself\\r\\nby noble actions; he forms extensive plans for the improvement and the\\r\\nhappiness of his fellow creatures; he feels the want of power to carry\\r\\nthese into effect; power becomes the object of his wishes. In the\\r\\npursuit, in the attainment of this object, how are his feelings\\r\\nchanged! M. Necker, in the preface to his work on French finance,[99]\\r\\npaints, with much eloquence, and with an appearance of perfect truth,\\r\\nthe feelings of a man of virtue and genius, before and after the\\r\\nattainment of political power. The moment when a minister takes\\r\\npossession of his place, surrounded by crowds and congratulations, is\\r\\nwell described; and the succeeding moment, when clerks with immense\\r\\nportfolios enter, is a striking contrast. Examples from romance can\\r\\nnever have such a powerful effect upon the mind, as those which are\\r\\ntaken from real life; but in proportion to the just and lively\\r\\nrepresentation of situations, and passions resembling reality,\\r\\nfictions may convey useful moral lessons. In the Cyrop\\xc3\\xa6dia there is an\\r\\nadmirable description of the day spent by the victorious Cyrus, giving\\r\\naudience to the unmanageable multitude, after the taking of Babylon\\r\\nhad accomplished the fullness of his ambition.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been observed, that these examples of the insufficiency of the\\r\\nobjects of ambition to happiness, seldom make any lasting impression\\r\\nupon the minds of the ambitious. This may arise from two causes; from\\r\\nthe reasoning faculty\\'s not having been sufficiently cultivated, or\\r\\nfrom the habits of ambition being formed before proper examples are\\r\\npresented to the judgment for comparison. Some ambitious people, when\\r\\nthey reason coolly, acknowledge and feel the folly of their pursuits;\\r\\nbut still, from the force of habit, they act immediately in obedience\\r\\nto the motives which they condemn: others, who have never been\\r\\naccustomed to reason firmly, believe themselves to be in the right in\\r\\nthe choice of their objects; and they cannot comprehend the arguments\\r\\nwhich are used by those who have not the same way of thinking as\\r\\nthemselves. If we fairly place facts before young people, who have\\r\\nbeen habituated to reason, and who have not yet been inspired with the\\r\\npassion, or enslaved by the habits of vulgar ambition, it is probable,\\r\\nthat they will not be easily effaced from the memory, and that they\\r\\nwill influence the conduct through life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt sometimes happens to men of a sound understanding, and a\\r\\nphilosophic turn of mind, that their ambition decreases with their\\r\\nexperience. They begin with some ardor, perhaps, an ambitious pursuit;\\r\\nbut by degrees they find the pleasure of the occupation sufficient\\r\\nwithout the fame, which was their original object. This is the same\\r\\nprocess which we have observed in the minds of children with respect\\r\\nto the pleasures of literature, and the taste for sugar-plums.\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy the child who can be taught to improve himself without the\\r\\nstimulus of sweetmeats! Happy the man who can preserve activity\\r\\nwithout the excitements of ambition!\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[93] Gibbon.

We shall not apologize for offering a few\\r\\nremarks on some passages in these little books, because we are\\r\\nconvinced that we shall not offend.\\r\\n\\r\\nLessons for children from three to four years old, should, we think,\\r\\nhave been lessons for children from four to five years old; few read,\\r\\nor ought to read, before that age.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Charles shall have a pretty new lesson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this sentence the words pretty and new are associated; but they\\r\\nrepresent ideas which ought to be kept separate in the mind of a\\r\\nchild. The love of novelty is cherished in the minds of children by\\r\\nthe common expressions that we use to engage them to do what we\\r\\ndesire. \"You shall have a new whip, a new hat,\" are improper modes of\\r\\nexpression to a child. We have seen a boy who had literally twenty new\\r\\nwhips in one year, and we were present when his father, to comfort him\\r\\nwhen he was in pain, went out to buy him a _new_ whip, though he had\\r\\ntwo or three scattered about the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe description, in the first part of Mrs. Barbauld\\'s Lessons, of the\\r\\nnaughty boy who tormented the robin, and who was afterwards supposed\\r\\nto be eaten by bears, is more objectionable than any in the book: the\\r\\nidea of killing is in itself very complex, and, if explained, serves\\r\\nonly to excite terror; and how can a child be made to comprehend why a\\r\\ncat _should_ catch mice, and not kill birds? or why should this\\r\\nspecies of honesty be expected from an animal of prey?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want my dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes Charles take it for granted, that what he eats is his own, and\\r\\nthat he _must_ have his dinner? These and similar expressions are\\r\\nwords of course; but young children should not be allowed to use them:\\r\\nif they are permitted to assume the tone of command, the feelings of\\r\\nimpatience and ill temper quickly follow, and children become the\\r\\nlittle tyrants of a family. Property is a word of which young people\\r\\nhave general ideas, and they may, with very little trouble, be\\r\\nprevented from claiming things to which they have no right. Mrs.\\r\\nBarbauld has judiciously chosen to introduce a little boy\\'s daily\\r\\nhistory in these books; all children are extremely interested for\\r\\nCharles, and they are very apt to expect that every thing which\\r\\nhappens to him, is to happen to them; and they believe, that every\\r\\nthing he does, is right; therefore, his biographer should, in another\\r\\nedition, revise any of his expressions which may mislead the future\\r\\ntribe of his little imitators.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Maid, come and dress Charles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter what we have already said with respect to servants, we need only\\r\\nobserve, that this sentence for Charles should not be read by a child;\\r\\nand that in which the maid is said to bring home a gun, &c. it is easy\\r\\nto strike a pencil line across it. All the passages which might have\\r\\nbeen advantageously omitted in these excellent little books, have been\\r\\ncarefully obliterated before they were put into the hands of children,\\r\\nby a mother who knew the danger of early false associations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Little boys don\\'t eat butter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No body wears a hat in the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a very common method of speaking, but it certainly is not\\r\\nproper towards children. Affirmative sentences should always express\\r\\nreal facts. Charles must know that some little boys do eat butter;\\r\\nand that some people wear their hats in their houses. This mode of\\r\\nexpression, \"No body does that!\" \"Every body does this!\" lays the\\r\\nfoundation for prejudice in the mind. This is the language of fashion,\\r\\nwhich, more than conscience, makes cowards of us all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want some wine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWould it not be better to tell Charles, in reply to this speech, that\\r\\nwine is not good for him, than to say, \"Wine for little boys! I never\\r\\nheard of such a thing!\" If Charles were to be ill, and it should be\\r\\nnecessary to give him wine; or were he to see another child drink it,\\r\\nhe would lose confidence in what was said to him. We should be very\\r\\ncareful of our words, if we expect our pupils to have confidence in\\r\\nus; and if they have not, we need not attempt to educate them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The moon shines at night, when the sun is gone to bed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the sun is out of sight, would be more correct, though not so\\r\\npleasing, perhaps, to the young reader. It is very proper to teach a\\r\\nchild, that when the sun disappears, when the sun is below the\\r\\nhorizon, it is the time when most animals go to rest; but we should\\r\\nnot do this by giving so false an idea, as that the sun is gone to\\r\\nbed. Every thing relative to the system of the universe, is above the\\r\\ncomprehension of a child; we should, therefore, be careful to prevent\\r\\nhis forming erroneous opinions. We should wait for a riper period of\\r\\nhis understanding, before we attempt positive instruction upon\\r\\nabstract subjects.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enumeration of the months in the year, the days in the week, of\\r\\nmetals, &c. are excellent lessons for a child who is just beginning to\\r\\nlearn to read. The classification of animals into quadrupeds, bipeds,\\r\\n&c. is another useful specimen of the manner in which children should\\r\\nbe taught to generalize their ideas. The pathetic description of the\\r\\npoor timid hare running from the hunters, will leave an impression\\r\\nupon the young and humane heart, which may, perhaps, save the life of\\r\\nmany a hare. The poetic beauty and eloquent simplicity of many of Mrs.\\r\\nBarbauld\\'s Lessons, cultivate the imagination of children, and their\\r\\ntaste, in the best possible manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe description of the white swan with her long arched neck, \"winning\\r\\nher easy way\" through the waters, is beautiful; so is that of the\\r\\nnightingale singing upon her lone bush by moon-light. Poetic\\r\\ndescriptions of real objects, are well suited to children; apostrophe\\r\\nand personification they understand; but all allegoric poetry is\\r\\ndifficult to manage for them, because they mistake the poetic\\r\\nattributes for reality, and they acquire false and confused ideas.\\r\\nWith regret children close Mrs. Barbauld\\'s little books, and parents\\r\\nbecome yet more sensible of their value, when they perceive that none\\r\\ncan be found immediately to supply their place, or to continue the\\r\\ncourse of agreeable ideas which they have raised in the young pupil\\'s\\r\\nimagination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Evenings at Home,\" do not immediately join to Lessons for Children\\r\\nfrom three to four years old; and we know not where to find any books\\r\\nto fill the interval properly. The popular character of any book is\\r\\neasily learned, and its general merit easily ascertained; this may\\r\\nsatisfy careless, indolent tutors, but a more minute investigation is\\r\\nnecessary to parents who are anxious for the happiness of their\\r\\nfamily, or desirous to improve the art of education. Such parents will\\r\\nfeel it to be their duty to look over every page of a book before it\\r\\nis trusted to their children; it is an arduous task, but none can be\\r\\ntoo arduous for the enlightened energy of parental affection. We are\\r\\nacquainted with the mother of a family, who has never trusted any book\\r\\nto her children, without having first examined it herself with the\\r\\nmost scrupulous attention; her care has been repaid with that success\\r\\nin education, which such care can alone ensure. We have several books\\r\\nbefore us marked by her pencil, and volumes which, having undergone\\r\\nsome necessary operations by her scissors, would, in their mutilated\\r\\nstate, shock the sensibility of a nice librarian. But shall the\\r\\neducation of a family be sacrificed to the beauty of a page, or even\\r\\nto the binding of a book? Few books can safely be given to children\\r\\nwithout the previous use of the pen, the pencil, and the scissors. In\\r\\nthe books which we have before us, in their corrected state, we see\\r\\nsometimes a few words blotted out, sometimes half a page, sometimes\\r\\nmany pages are cut out. In turning over the leaves of \"The Children\\'s\\r\\nFriend,\" we perceive, that the different ages at which different\\r\\nstories should be read, have been marked; and we were surprised to\\r\\nmeet with some stories marked for six years old, and some for sixteen,\\r\\nin the same volume. We see that different stories have been marked\\r\\nwith the initials of different names by this cautious mother, who\\r\\nconsidered the temper and habits of her children, as well as their\\r\\nages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as these notes refer peculiarly to her own family, they cannot\\r\\nbe of use to the public; but the principles which governed a judicious\\r\\nparent in her selection, must be capable of universal application.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be laid down as a first principle, that we should preserve\\r\\nchildren from the knowledge of any vice, or any folly, of which the\\r\\nidea has never yet entered their minds, and which they are not\\r\\nnecessarily disposed to learn by early example. Children who have\\r\\nnever lived with servants, who have never associated with ill educated\\r\\ncompanions of their own age, and who, in their own family, have heard\\r\\nnothing but good conversation, and seen none but good examples, will,\\r\\nin their language, their manners, and their whole disposition, be not\\r\\nonly free from many of the faults common amongst children, but they\\r\\nwill absolutely have no idea that there are such faults. The language\\r\\nof children who have heard no language but what is good, must be\\r\\ncorrect. On the contrary, children who hear a mixture of low and high\\r\\nvulgarity before their own habits are fixed, must, whenever they\\r\\nspeak, continually blunder; they have no rule to guide their judgment\\r\\nin their selection from the variety of dialects which they hear;\\r\\nprobably they may often be reproved for their mistakes, but these\\r\\nreproofs will be of no avail, whilst the pupils continue to be puzzled\\r\\nbetween the example of the nursery and of the drawing-room. It will\\r\\ncost much time and pains to correct these defects, which might have\\r\\nbeen with little difficulty prevented. It is the same with other bad\\r\\nhabits. Falsehood, caprice, dishonesty, obstinacy, revenge, and all\\r\\nthe train of vices which are the consequences of mistaken or neglected\\r\\neducation, which are learned by bad example, and which are not\\r\\ninspired by nature, need scarcely be known to children whose minds\\r\\nhave from their infancy been happily regulated. Such children should\\r\\nsedulously be kept from contagion. No books should be put into the\\r\\nhands of this happy class of children, but such as present the best\\r\\nmodels of virtue: there is no occasion to shock them with caricatures\\r\\nof vice. Such caricatures they will even understand to be well drawn,\\r\\nbecause they are unacquainted with any thing like the originals.\\r\\nExamples to deter them from faults to which they have no propensity,\\r\\nmust be useless, and may be dangerous. For the same reason that a book\\r\\nwritten in bad language, should never be put into the hands of a child\\r\\nwho speaks correctly, a book exhibiting instances of vice, should\\r\\nnever be given to a child who thinks and acts correctly. The love of\\r\\nnovelty and of imitation, is so strong in children, that even for the\\r\\npleasure of imitating characters described in a book, or actions which\\r\\nstrike them as singular, they often commit real faults.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this danger of catching faults by sympathy, children of the\\r\\ngreatest simplicity are, perhaps, the most liable, because they least\\r\\nunderstand the nature and consequences of the actions which they\\r\\nimitate.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the age of imitation, children should not be exposed to the\\r\\ninfluence of any bad examples until their habits are formed, and until\\r\\nthey have not only the sense to choose, but the fortitude to abide\\r\\nby, their own choice. It may be said, that \"children must know that\\r\\nvice exists; that, even amongst their own companions, there are some\\r\\nwho have bad dispositions; they cannot mix even in the society of\\r\\nchildren, without seeing examples which they ought to be prepared to\\r\\navoid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese remarks are just with regard to pupils who are intended for a\\r\\npublic school, and no great nicety in the selection of their books is\\r\\nnecessary; but we are now speaking of children who are to be brought\\r\\nup in a private family. Why should they be prepared to mix in the\\r\\nsociety of children who have bad habits or bad dispositions? Children\\r\\nshould not be educated for the society of children; nor should they\\r\\nlive in that society during their education. We must not expect from\\r\\nthem premature prudence, and all the social virtues, before we have\\r\\ntaken any measures to produce these virtues, or this tardy prudence.\\r\\nIn private education, there is little chance that one errour should\\r\\nbalance another; the experience of the pupil is much confined; the\\r\\nexamples which he sees, are not so numerous and various as to\\r\\ncounteract each other. Nothing, therefore, must be expected from the\\r\\ncounteracting influence of opposing causes; nothing should be trusted\\r\\nto chance. Experience must preserve one uniform tenour; and examples\\r\\nmust be selected with circumspection. The less children associate with\\r\\ncompanions of their own age, the less they know of the world; the\\r\\nstronger their taste for literature; the more forcible will be the\\r\\nimpression that will be made upon them by the pictures of life, and\\r\\nthe characters and sentiments which they meet with in books. Books for\\r\\nsuch children, ought to be _sifted_ by an academy[101] of enlightened\\r\\nparents.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout particular examples, the most obvious truths are not brought\\r\\nhome to our business. We shall select a few examples from a work of\\r\\nhigh and deserved reputation, from a work which we much admire,\\r\\n\"Berquin\\'s Children\\'s Friend.\" We do not mean to criticise this work\\r\\nas a literary production; but simply to point out to parents, that,\\r\\neven in the best books for children, much must still be left to the\\r\\njudgment of the preceptor; much in the choice of stories, and\\r\\nparticular passages suited to different pupils.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn \"The Children\\'s Friend,\" there are several stories well adapted to\\r\\none class of children, but entirely unfit for another. In the story\\r\\ncalled the Hobgoblin, Antonia, a little girl \"who has been told a\\r\\nhundred foolish stories by her maid, particularly one about a\\r\\nblack-faced goblin,\" is represented as making a lamentable outcry at\\r\\nthe sight of a chimney-sweeper; first she runs for refuge to the\\r\\nkitchen, the last place to which she should run; then to the pantry;\\r\\nthence she jumps out of the window, \"half dead with terror,\" and, in\\r\\nthe elegant language of the translator, _almost splits her throat with\\r\\ncrying out Help! Help!_--In a few minutes she discovers her errour, is\\r\\nheartily ashamed, and \"ever afterwards Antonia was the first to laugh\\r\\nat silly stories, told by silly people, of hobgoblins and the like, to\\r\\nfrighten her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor children who have had the misfortune to have heard the hundred\\r\\nfoolish stories of a foolish maid, this apparition of the\\r\\nchimney-sweeper is well managed; though, perhaps, ridicule might not\\r\\neffect so sudden st cure in all cases as it did in that of Antonia. By\\r\\nchildren who have not acquired terrors of the black-faced goblin, and\\r\\nwho have not the habit of frequenting the kitchen and the pantry, this\\r\\nstory should never be read.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The little miss deceived by her maid,\" who takes her mamma\\'s keys out\\r\\nof her drawers, and who steals sugar and tea for her maid, that she\\r\\nmay have the pleasure of playing with a cousin whom her mother had\\r\\nforbidden her to see, is not an example that need be introduced into\\r\\nany well regulated family. The picture of Amelia\\'s misery, is drawn by\\r\\nthe hand of a master. Terror and pity, we are told by the tragic\\r\\npoets, purify the mind; but there are minds that do not require this\\r\\nspecies of purification. Powerful antidotes are necessary to combat\\r\\npowerful poisons; but where no poison has been imbibed, are not\\r\\nantidotes more dangerous than useful?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stories called \"The Little Gamblers; Blind Man\\'s Buff; and Honesty\\r\\nthe best Policy,\" are stories which may do a great deal of good to bad\\r\\nchildren, but they should never be given to those of another\\r\\ndescription. The young gentlemen who cheat at cards, and who pocket\\r\\nsilver fish, should have no admittance any where. It is not necessary\\r\\nto put _children_ upon their guard against associates whom they are\\r\\nnot likely to meet; nor need we introduce The Vulgar and Mischievous\\r\\nSchool-Boy, to any but school-boys. Martin, who throws squibs at\\r\\npeople in the street, who fastens rabbits\\' tails behind their backs,\\r\\nwho fishes for their wigs, who sticks up pins in his friends\\' chairs,\\r\\nwho carries a hideous mask in his pocket to frighten little children,\\r\\nand who is himself frightened into repentance by a spectre with a\\r\\nspeaking trumpet, is a very objectionable, though an excellent\\r\\ndramatic character. The part of the spectre is played by the groom;\\r\\nthis is ill contrived in a drama for children; grooms should have\\r\\nnothing to do with their entertainments; and C\\xc3\\xa6sar, who is represented\\r\\nas a pleasing character, should not be supposed to make the postillion\\r\\na party in his inventions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_A good heart compensates for many indiscretions_,\" is a dangerous\\r\\ntitle for a play for young people; because _many_ is an indefinite\\r\\nterm; and in settling how many, the calculations of parents and\\r\\nchildren may vary materially. This little play is so charmingly\\r\\nwritten, the character of the imprudent and generous Frederick is so\\r\\nlikely to excite imitation, that we must doubly regret his intimacy\\r\\nwith the coachman, his running away from school, and drinking beer at\\r\\nan ale-house in a fair. The coachman is an excellent old man; he is\\r\\nturned away for having let master Frederick mount his box, assume the\\r\\nwhip, and overturn a handsome carriage. Frederick, touched with\\r\\ngratitude and compassion, gives the old man all his pocket money, and\\r\\nsells a watch and some books to buy clothes for him. The motives of\\r\\nFrederick\\'s conduct are excellent, and, as they are misrepresented by\\r\\na treacherous and hypocritical cousin, we sympathize more strongly\\r\\nwith the hero of the piece; and all his indiscretions appear, at\\r\\nleast, amiable defects. A nice observer[102] of the human heart says,\\r\\nthat we are never inclined to to cure ourselves of any defect which\\r\\nmakes us agreeable. Frederick\\'s real virtues will not, probably,\\r\\nexcite imitation so much as his imaginary excellences. We should take\\r\\nthe utmost care not to associate in the mind the ideas of imprudence\\r\\nand of generosity; of hypocrisy and of prudence: on the contrary, it\\r\\nshould be shown that prudence is necessary to real benevolence; that\\r\\nno virtue is more useful, and consequently more respectable, than\\r\\njustice. These homely truths will never be attended to as the\\r\\ncounter-check moral of an interesting story; stories which require\\r\\nsuch morals, should, therefore, be avoided.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is to be hoped, that select parts of The Children\\'s Friend,[103]\\r\\ntranslated by some able hand, will be published hereafter for the use\\r\\nof private families. Many of the stories, to which we have ventured to\\r\\nobject, are by no means unfit for school-boys, to whom the characters\\r\\nwhich are most exceptionable cannot be new. The vulgarity of language\\r\\nwhich we have noticed, is not to be attributed to M. Berquin, but to\\r\\nhis wretched translator. L\\'Ami des Enfans, is, in French, remarkably\\r\\nelegantly written. The Little Canary Bird, Little George, The\\r\\nTalkative Little Girl, The Four Seasons, and many others, are\\r\\nexcellent both in point of style and dramatic effect; they are exactly\\r\\nsuited to the understandings of children; and they interest without\\r\\nany improbable events, or unnatural characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fiction it is difficult to avoid giving children false ideas of\\r\\nvirtue, and still more difficult to keep the different virtues in\\r\\ntheir due proportions. This should be attended to with care in all\\r\\nbooks for young people; nor should we sacrifice the understanding to\\r\\nthe enthusiasm of eloquence, or the affectation of sensibility.\\r\\nWithout the habit of reasoning, the best dispositions can give us no\\r\\nsolid security for happiness; therefore, we should early cultivate the\\r\\nreasoning faculty, instead of always appealing to the imagination. By\\r\\nsentimental persuasives, a child may be successfully governed for a\\r\\ntime, but that time will be of short duration, and no power can\\r\\ncontinue the delusion long.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the dialogue upon this maxim, \"that a competence is best,\" the\\r\\nreasoning of the father is not a match for that of the son; by using\\r\\nless eloquence, the father might have made out his case much better.\\r\\nThe boy sees that many people are richer than his father, and\\r\\nperceiving that their riches procure a great number of conveniences\\r\\nand comforts for them, he asks why his father, who is as good as these\\r\\nopulent people, should not also be as rich. His father tells him, that\\r\\nhe is rich, that he has a large garden, and a fine estate; the boy\\r\\nasks to see it, and his father takes him to the top of a high hill,\\r\\nand, showing him an extensive prospect, says to him, \"All this is my\\r\\nestate.\" The boy cross questions his father, and finds out that it is\\r\\nnot his estate, but that he may enjoy the pleasure of looking at it;\\r\\nthat he can buy wood when he wants it for firing; venison, without\\r\\nhunting the deer himself; fish, without fishing; and butter, without\\r\\npossessing all the cows that graze in the valley; therefore he calls\\r\\nhimself master of the woods, the deer, the herds, the huntsmen, and\\r\\nthe labourers that he beholds. This is[104] poetic philosophy, but it\\r\\nis not sufficiently accurate for a child; it would confound his ideas\\r\\nof property, and it would be immediately contradicted by his\\r\\nexperience. The father\\'s reasoning is perfectly good, and well adapted\\r\\nto his pupil\\'s capacity, when he asks, \"whether he should not require\\r\\na superfluous appetite to enjoy superfluous dishes at his meals.\" In\\r\\nreturning from his walk, the boy sees a mill that is out of repair, a\\r\\nmeadow that is flooded, and a quantity of hay spoiled; he observes,\\r\\nthat the owners of these things must be sadly vexed by such accidents,\\r\\nand his father congratulates himself upon their not being his\\r\\nproperty. Here is a direct contradiction; for a few minutes before he\\r\\nhad asserted that they belonged to him. Property is often the cause of\\r\\nmuch anxiety to its possessor; but the question is, whether the pains,\\r\\nor the pleasures of possessing it, predominate; if this question could\\r\\nnot be fully discussed, it should not be partially stated. To silence\\r\\na child in argument is easy, to convince him is difficult; sophistry\\r\\nor wit should never be used to confound the understanding. Reason has\\r\\nequal force from the lips of the giant and of the dwarf.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese minute criticisms may appear invidious; but it is hoped that\\r\\nthey will be considered only as illustrations of general principles;\\r\\nillustrations necessary to our subject. We have chosen M. Berquin\\'s\\r\\nwork because of its universal popularity; probably all the examples\\r\\nwhich have been selected, are in the recollection of most readers, or\\r\\nat least it is easy to refer to them, because \"The Children\\'s Friend\"\\r\\nis to be found in every house where there are any children. The\\r\\nprinciples by which we have examined Berquin, may be applied to all\\r\\nbooks of the same class. Sandford and Merton, Madame de Silleri\\'s\\r\\nTheatre of Education, and her Tales of the Castle, Madame de la Fite\\'s\\r\\nTales and Conversations, Mrs. Smith\\'s Rural Walks, with a long list of\\r\\nother books for children, which have considerable merit, would deserve\\r\\na separate analysis, if literary criticism were our object. A critic\\r\\nonce, with indefatigable ill-nature, picked out all the faults of a\\r\\nbeautiful poem, and presented them to Apollo. The god ordered a\\r\\nbushel of his best Parnassian wheat to be carefully winnowed, and he\\r\\npresented the critic with the chaff. Our wish is to separate the small\\r\\nportion of what is useless, from the excellent nutriment contained in\\r\\nthe books we have mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith respect to sentimental stories,[105] and books of mere\\r\\nentertainment, we must remark, that they should be sparingly used,\\r\\nespecially in the education of girls. This species of reading,\\r\\ncultivates what is called the heart prematurely; lowers the tone of\\r\\nthe mind, and induces indifference for those common pleasures and\\r\\noccupations which, however trivial in themselves, constitute by far\\r\\nthe greatest portion of our daily happiness. Stories are the novels of\\r\\nchildhood. We know, from common experience, the effects which are\\r\\nproduced upon the female mind by immoderate novel reading. To those\\r\\nwho acquire this taste, every object becomes disgusting which is not\\r\\nin an attitude for poetic painting; a species of moral picturesque is\\r\\nsought for in every scene of life, and this is not always compatible\\r\\nwith sound sense, or with simple reality. Gainsborough\\'s Country Girl,\\r\\nas it has been humorously[106] remarked, \"is a much more picturesque\\r\\nobject, than a girl neatly dressed in a clean white frock; but for\\r\\nthis reason, are all children to go in rags?\" A tragedy heroine,\\r\\nweeping, swooning, dying, is a moral picturesque object; but the\\r\\nfrantic passions, which have the best effect upon the stage, might,\\r\\nwhen exhibited in domestic life, appear to be drawn upon too large a\\r\\nscale to please. The difference between reality and fiction, is so\\r\\ngreat, that those who copy from any thing but nature, are continually\\r\\ndisposed to make mistakes in their conduct, which appear ludicrous to\\r\\nthe impartial spectator. Pathos depends on such nice circumstances,\\r\\nthat domestic, sentimental distresses, are in a perilous situation;\\r\\nthe sympathy of their audience, is not always in the power of the fair\\r\\nperformers. Frenzy itself may be turned to farce.[107] \"Enter the\\r\\nprincess mad in white satin, and her attendant mad in white linen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the danger of creating a romantic taste, there is reason to\\r\\nbelieve, that the species of reading to which we object, has an effect\\r\\ndirectly opposite to what it is intended to produce. It diminishes,\\r\\ninstead of increasing, the sensibility of the heart; a combination of\\r\\nromantic imagery, is requisite to act upon the associations of\\r\\nsentimental people, and they are virtuous only when virtue is in\\r\\nperfectly good taste. An eloquent philosopher[108] observes, that in\\r\\nthe description of scenes of distress in romance and poetry, the\\r\\ndistress is always made _elegant_; the imagination, which has been\\r\\naccustomed to this delicacy in fictitious narrations, revolts from the\\r\\ndisgusting circumstances which attend real poverty, disease and\\r\\nmisery; the emotions of pity, and the exertions of benevolence, are\\r\\nconsequently repressed precisely at the time when they are necessary\\r\\nto humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith respect to pity, it is a spontaneous, natural emotion, which is\\r\\nstrongly felt by children, but they cannot properly be said to feel\\r\\nbenevolence till they are capable of reasoning. Charity must, in them,\\r\\nbe a very doubtful virtue; they cannot be competent judges as to the\\r\\ngeneral utility of what they give. Persons of the most enlarged\\r\\nunderstanding, find it necessary to be extremely cautious in\\r\\ncharitable donations, lest they should do more harm than good.\\r\\nChildren cannot see beyond the first link in the chain which holds\\r\\nsociety together; at the best, then, their charity can be but a\\r\\npartial virtue. But in fact, children have nothing to give; they think\\r\\nthat they give, when they dispose of property of their parents; they\\r\\nsuffer no privation from this sort of generosity, and they learn\\r\\nostentation, instead of practising self-denial. Berquin, in his\\r\\nexcellent story of \"The Little Needle Woman,\" has made the children\\r\\ngive their own work; here the pleasure of employment is immediately\\r\\nconnected with the gratification of benevolent feelings; their pity is\\r\\nnot merely passive, it is active and useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fictitious narratives, affection for parents, and for brothers and\\r\\nsisters, is often painted in agreeable colours, to excite the\\r\\nadmiration and sympathy of children. Caroline, the charming little\\r\\ngirl, who gets upon a chair to wipe away the tears that trickle down\\r\\nher eldest sister\\'s cheek when her mother is displeased with her,[109]\\r\\nforms a natural and beautiful picture; but the desire to imitate\\r\\nCaroline must produce affectation. All the simplicity of youth, is\\r\\ngone the moment children perceive that they are extolled for the\\r\\nexpression of fine feelings, and fine sentiments. Gratitude, esteem\\r\\nand affection, do not depend upon the table of consanguinity; they are\\r\\ninvoluntary feelings, which cannot be raised at pleasure by the voice\\r\\nof authority; they will not obey the dictates of interest; they\\r\\nsecretly despise the anathemas of sentiment. Esteem and affection, are\\r\\nthe necessary consequences of a certain course of conduct, combined\\r\\nwith certain external circumstances, which are, more or less, in the\\r\\npower of every individual. To arrange these circumstances prudently,\\r\\nand to pursue a proper course of conduct steadily, something more is\\r\\nnecessary than the transitory impulse of sensibility, or of\\r\\nenthusiasm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a class of books which amuse the imagination of children,\\r\\nwithout acting upon their feelings. We do not allude to fairy tales,\\r\\nfor we apprehend that these are not now much read; but we mean voyages\\r\\nand travels; these interest young people universally. Robinson Crusoe,\\r\\nGulliver, and the Three Russian Sailors, who were cast away upon the\\r\\ncoast of Norway, are general favourites. No child ever read an account\\r\\nof a shipwreck, or even a storm, without pleasure. A desert island is\\r\\na delightful place, to be equalled only by the skating land of the\\r\\nrein-deer, or by the valley of diamonds in the Arabian Tales. Savages,\\r\\nespecially if they be cannibals, are sure to be admired, and the more\\r\\nhair-breadth escapes the hero of the tale has survived, and the more\\r\\nmarvellous his adventures, the more sympathy he excites.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nWill it be thought to proceed from a spirit of contradiction, if we\\r\\nremark, that this species of reading should not early be chosen for\\r\\nboys of an enterprising temper, unless they are intended for a\\r\\nsea-faring life, or for the army? The taste for adventure, is\\r\\nabsolutely incompatible with the sober perseverance necessary to\\r\\nsuccess in any other liberal professions. To girls, this species of\\r\\nreading cannot be as dangerous as it is to boys; girls must very soon\\r\\nperceive the impossibility of their rambling about the world in quest\\r\\nof adventures; and where there appears an obvious impossibility in\\r\\ngratifying any wish, it is not likely to become, or at least to\\r\\ncontinue, a torment to the imagination. Boys, on the contrary, from\\r\\nthe habits of their education, are prone to admire, and to imitate,\\r\\nevery thing like enterprise and heroism. Courage and fortitude, are\\r\\nthe virtues of men, and it is natural that boys should desire, if they\\r\\nbelieve that they possess these virtues, to be placed in those great\\r\\nand extraordinary situations which can display them to advantage. The\\r\\ntaste for adventure, is not repressed in boys by the impossibility of\\r\\nits indulgence; the world is before them, and they think that fame\\r\\npromises the highest prize to those who will most boldly venture in\\r\\nthe lottery of fortune. The rational probability of success, few young\\r\\npeople are able, fewer still are willing, to calculate; and the\\r\\ncalculations of prudent friends, have little power over their\\r\\nunderstandings, or at least, over their imagination, the part of the\\r\\nunderstanding which is most likely to decide their conduct.--From\\r\\ngeneral maxims, we cannot expect that young people should learn much\\r\\nprudence; each individual admits the propriety of the rule, yet\\r\\nbelieves himself to be a privileged exception. Where any prize is\\r\\nsupposed to be in the gift of fortune, every man, or every young man,\\r\\ntakes it for granted that he is a favourite, and that it will be\\r\\nbestowed upon him. The profits of commerce and of agriculture, the\\r\\nprofits of every art and profession, can be estimated with tolerable\\r\\naccuracy; the value of activity, application and abilities, can be\\r\\nrespectively measured by some certain standard. Modest, or even\\r\\nprudent people, will scruple to rate themselves in all of these\\r\\nqualifications superior to their neighbours; but every man will allow\\r\\nthat, in point of good fortune, at any game of chance, he thinks\\r\\nhimself upon a fair level with every other competitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a young man deliberates upon what course of life he shall follow,\\r\\nthe patient drudgery of a trade, the laborious mental exertions\\r\\nrequisite to prepare him for a profession, must appear to him in a\\r\\nformidable light, compared with the alluring prospects presented by an\\r\\nadventuring imagination. At this time of life, it will be too late\\r\\nsuddenly to change the taste; it will be inconvenient, if not\\r\\ninjurious, to restrain a young man\\'s inclinations by force or\\r\\nauthority; it will be imprudent, perhaps fatally imprudent, to leave\\r\\nthem uncontroled. Precautions should therefore be taken long before\\r\\nthis period, and the earlier they are taken, the better. It is not\\r\\nidle refinement to assert, that the first impressions which are made\\r\\nupon the imagination, though they may be changed by subsequent\\r\\ncircumstances, yet are discernible in every change, and are seldom\\r\\nentirely effaced from the mind, though it may be difficult to trace\\r\\nthem through all their various appearances. A boy, who at seven years\\r\\nold, longs to be Robinson Crusoe, or Sinbad the sailor, may at\\r\\nseventeen, retain the same taste for adventure and enterprise, though\\r\\nmixed so as to be less discernible, with the incipient passions of\\r\\navarice and ambition; he has the same dispositions modified by a\\r\\nslight knowledge of real life, and guided by the manners and\\r\\nconversation of his friends and acquaintance. Robinson Crusoe and\\r\\nSinbad, will no longer be his favourite heroes; but he will now admire\\r\\nthe soldier of fortune, the commercial adventurer, or the nabob, who\\r\\nhas discovered in the east the secret of Aladdin\\'s wonderful lamp; and\\r\\nwho has realized the treasures of Aboulcasem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of realities, written in an entertaining manner, appears\\r\\nnot only better suited to the purposes of education, but also more\\r\\nagreeable to young people than improbable fictions. We have seen the\\r\\nreasons why it is dangerous to pamper the taste early with mere books\\r\\nof entertainment; to voyages and travels, we have made some\\r\\nobjections. Natural history, is a study particularly suited to\\r\\nchildren: it cultivates their talents for observation, applies to\\r\\nobjects within their reach, and to objects which are every day\\r\\ninteresting to them. The histories of the bee, the ant, the\\r\\ncaterpillar, the butterfly, the silk-worm, are the first things that\\r\\nplease the taste of children, and these are the histories of\\r\\nrealities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst books of mere entertainment, no one can be so injudicious, or\\r\\nso unjust, as to class the excellent \"Evenings at Home.\" Upon a close\\r\\nexamination, it appears to be one of the best books for young people\\r\\nfrom seven to ten years old, that has yet appeared. We shall not\\r\\npretend to enter into a minute examination of it; because, from what\\r\\nwe have already said, parents can infer our sentiments, and we wish to\\r\\navoid tedious, unnecessary detail. We shall, however, just observe,\\r\\nthat the lessons on natural history, on metals, and on chemistry, are\\r\\nparticularly useful, not so much from the quantity of knowledge which,\\r\\nthey contain, as by the agreeable manner in which it is communicated:\\r\\nthe mind is opened to extensive views, at the same time that nothing\\r\\nabove the comprehension of children is introduced. The mixture of\\r\\nmoral and, scientific lessons, is happily managed so as to relieve\\r\\nthe attention; some of the moral lessons, contain sound argument, and\\r\\nsome display just views of life. \"Perseverance against Fortune;\" \"The\\r\\nPrice of Victory;\" \"Eyes and no Eyes,\" have been generally admired as\\r\\nmuch by parents as by children.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a little book called \"Leisure Hours,\" which contains a great\\r\\ndeal of knowledge suited to young people; but they must observe, that\\r\\nthe style is not elegant; perhaps, in a future edition, the style may\\r\\nbe revised. The \"Conversations d\\'Emile,\" are elegantly written, and\\r\\nthe character of the mother and child admirably well preserved. White\\r\\nof Selborne\\'s Naturalist\\'s Calendar, we can recommend with entire\\r\\napprobation: it is written in a familiar, yet elegant style; and the\\r\\njournal form, gives it that air of reality which is so agreeable and\\r\\ninteresting to the mind. Mr. White will make those who have observed,\\r\\nobserve the more, and will excite the spirit of observation in those\\r\\nwho never before observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmellie\\'s Natural History, is a useful, entertaining book; but it\\r\\n_must_ be carefully looked over, and many pages and half pages must be\\r\\nentirely sacrificed. And here one general caution may be necessary. It\\r\\nis hazarding too much, to make children promise not to read parts of\\r\\nany book which is put into their hands; when the book is too valuable,\\r\\nin the parent\\'s estimation, to be cut or blotted, let it not be given\\r\\nto children when they are alone; in a parent\\'s presence, there is no\\r\\ndanger, and the children will acquire the habit of reading the\\r\\npassages that are selected without feeling curiosity about the rest.\\r\\nAs young people grow up, they will judge of the selections that have\\r\\nbeen made for them; they will perceive why such a passage was fit for\\r\\ntheir understanding at one period, which they could not have\\r\\nunderstood at another. If they are never forced to read what is\\r\\ntiresome, they will anxiously desire to have passages selected for\\r\\nthem; and they will not imagine that their parents are capricious in\\r\\nthese selections; but they will, we speak from experience, be\\r\\nsincerely grateful to them for the time and trouble bestowed in\\r\\nprocuring their literary amusements.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen young people have established their character for truth and exact\\r\\nintegrity, they should be entirely trusted with books as with every\\r\\nthing else. A slight pencil line at the side of a page, will then be\\r\\nall that is necessary to guide them to the best parts of any book.\\r\\nSuspicion would be as injurious, as too easy a faith is imprudent:\\r\\nconfidence confirms integrity; but the habits of truth must be formed\\r\\nbefore dangerous temptations are presented. We intended to have given\\r\\na list of books, and to have named the pages in several authors, which\\r\\nhave been found interesting to children from seven to nine or ten\\r\\nyears old. The Reviews; The Annual Registers; Enfield\\'s Speaker;\\r\\n_Elegant Extracts_; The Papers of the Manchester Society; The French\\r\\nAcademy of Sciences; Priestley\\'s History of Vision; and parts of the\\r\\nWorks of Franklin, of Chaptal, Lavoisier and Darwin, have supplied us\\r\\nwith our best materials. Some periodical papers from the World,\\r\\nRambler, Guardian, and Adventurer, have been chosen: these are books\\r\\nwith which all libraries are furnished. But we forbear to offer any\\r\\nlist; the passages we should have mentioned, have been found to please\\r\\nin one family; but we are sensible, that as circumstances vary, the\\r\\nchoice of books for different families, ought to be different. Every\\r\\nparent must be capable of selecting those passages in books which are\\r\\nmost suited to the age, temper, and taste of their children. Much of\\r\\nthe success, both of literary and moral education, will depend upon\\r\\nour seizing the happy moments for instruction; moments when knowledge\\r\\nimmediately applies to what children are intent upon themselves; the\\r\\nstep which is to be taken by the understanding, should immediately\\r\\nfollow that which has already been secured. By watching the turn of\\r\\nmind, and by attending to the conversation of children, we may\\r\\nperceive exactly what will suit them in books; and we may preserve the\\r\\nconnection of their ideas without fatiguing their attention. A\\r\\nparagraph read aloud from the newspaper of the day, a passage from any\\r\\nbook which parents happen to be reading themselves, will catch the\\r\\nattention of the young people in a family, and will, perhaps, excite\\r\\nmore taste and more curiosity, than could be given by whole volumes\\r\\nread at times when the mind is indolent or intent upon other\\r\\noccupations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe custom of reading aloud for a great while together, is extremely\\r\\nfatiguing to children, and hurtful to their understandings; they learn\\r\\nto read on without the slightest attention or thought; the more\\r\\nfluently they read, the worse it is for them; for their preceptors,\\r\\nwhilst words and sentences are pronounced with tolerable emphasis,\\r\\nnever seem to suspect that the reader can be tired, or that his mind\\r\\nmay be absent from his book. The monotonous tones which are acquired\\r\\nby children who read a great deal aloud, are extremely disagreeable,\\r\\nand the habit cannot easily be broken: we may observe, that children\\r\\nwho have not acquired bad customs, always read as they speak, when\\r\\nthey understand what they read; but the moment when they come to any\\r\\nsentence which they do not comprehend, their voice alters, and they\\r\\nread with hesitation, or with false emphasis: to these signals a\\r\\npreceptor should always attend, and the passage should be explained\\r\\nbefore the pupil is taught to read it in a musical tone, or with the\\r\\nproper emphasis: thus children should be taught to read by the\\r\\nunderstanding, and not merely by the ear. Dialogues, dramas, and well\\r\\nwritten narratives, they always read _well_, and these should be their\\r\\nexercises in the art of reading: they should be allowed to put down\\r\\nthe book as soon as they are tired; but an attentive tutor will\\r\\nperceive when they ought to be stopped, _before_ the utmost point of\\r\\nfatigue. We have heard a boy of nine years old, who had never been\\r\\ntaught elocution by any reading master, read simple pathetic passages,\\r\\nand natural dialogues in \"Evenings at Home,\" in a manner which would\\r\\nhave made even Sterne\\'s critic forget his stop-watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy reading much at a time, it is true that a great number of books\\r\\nare run through in a few years; but this is not at all our object; on\\r\\nthe contrary, our greatest difficulty has been to find a sufficient\\r\\nnumber of books fit for children to read. If they early acquire a\\r\\nstrong taste for literature, no matter how few authors they may have\\r\\nperused. We have often heard young people exclaim, \"I\\'m glad I have\\r\\nnot read such a book--I have a great pleasure to come!\"--Is not this\\r\\nbetter than to see a child yawn over a work, and count the number of\\r\\ntiresome pages, whilst he says, \"I shall have got through this book by\\r\\nand by; and what must I read when I have done this? I believe I never\\r\\nshall have read all I am to read! What a number of tiresome books\\r\\nthere are in the world! I wonder what can be the reason that I must\\r\\nread them all! If I were but allowed to skip the pages that I don\\'t\\r\\nunderstand, I should be much happier, for when I come to any thing\\r\\nentertaining in a book, I can keep myself awake, and then I like\\r\\nreading as well as any body does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFar from forbidding to skip the incomprehensible pages, or to close\\r\\nthe tiresome volume, we should exhort our pupils never to read one\\r\\nsingle page that tires, or that they do not fully understand. We need\\r\\nnot fear, that, because an excellent book is not interesting at one\\r\\nperiod of education, it should not become interesting at another; the\\r\\nchild is always the best judge of what is suited to his present\\r\\ncapacity. If he says, \"Such a book tires me,\" the preceptor should\\r\\nnever answer with a forbidding, reproachful look, \"I am surprised at\\r\\nthat, it is no great proof of your taste; the book, which you say\\r\\ntires you, is written by one of the best authors in the English\\r\\nlanguage.\" The boy is sorry for it, but he cannot help it; and he\\r\\nconcludes, if he be of a timid temper, that he has no taste for\\r\\nliterature, since the best authors in the English language tire him.\\r\\nIt is in vain to tell him, that the book is \"universally allowed to be\\r\\nvery entertaining.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"If it be not such to me,\\r\\n    What care I how fine it be!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more encouraging and more judicious parent would answer upon a\\r\\nsimilar occasion, \"You are very right not to read what tires you, my\\r\\ndear; and I am glad that you have sense enough to tell me that this\\r\\nbook does not entertain you, though it is written by one of the best\\r\\nauthors in the English language. We do not think at all the worse of\\r\\nyour taste and understanding; we know that the day will come when this\\r\\nbook will probably entertain you; put it by until then, I advise you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be thought, that young people who read only those parts of\\r\\nbooks which are entertaining, or those which are selected for them,\\r\\nare in danger of learning a taste for variety, and desultory habits,\\r\\nwhich may prevent their acquiring accurate knowledge upon any subject,\\r\\nand which may render them incapable of that literary application,\\r\\nwithout which nothing can be well learned. We hope the candid\\r\\npreceptor will suspend his judgment, until we can explain our\\r\\nsentiments upon this subject more fully, when we examine the nature of\\r\\ninvention and memory.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe secret fear, that stimulates parents to compel their children to\\r\\nconstant application to certain books, arises from the opinion, that\\r\\nmuch chronological and historical knowledge must at all events be\\r\\nacquired during a certain number of years. The knowledge of history is\\r\\nthought a necessary accomplishment in one sex, and an essential part\\r\\nof education in the other. We ought, however, to distinguish between\\r\\nthat knowledge of history and of chronology which is really useful,\\r\\nand that which is acquired merely for parade. We must call that useful\\r\\nknowledge, which enlarges the view of human life and of human nature,\\r\\nwhich teaches by the experience of the past, what we may expect in\\r\\nfuture. To study history as it relates to these objects, the pupil\\r\\nmust have acquired much previous knowledge; the habit of reasoning,\\r\\nand the power of combining distant analogies. The works of Hume, of\\r\\nRobertson, Gibbon, or Voltaire, can be properly understood only by\\r\\nwell informed and highly cultivated understandings. Enlarged views of\\r\\npolicy, some knowledge of the interests of commerce, of the progress\\r\\nand state of civilization and literature in different countries, are\\r\\nnecessary to whoever studies these authors with real advantage.\\r\\nWithout these, the finest sense, and the finest writing, must be\\r\\nutterly thrown away upon the reader. Children, consequently, under the\\r\\nname of fashionable histories, often read what to them is absolute\\r\\nnonsense: they have very little motive for the study of history, and\\r\\nall that we can say to keep alive their interest, amounts to the\\r\\ncommon argument, \"that such information will be useful to them\\r\\nhereafter, when they hear history mentioned in conversation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people imagine, that the memory resembles a store-house, in which\\r\\nwe should early lay up facts; and they assert, that, however useless\\r\\nthese may appear at the time when they are laid up, they will\\r\\nafterwards be ready for service at our summons. One allusion may be\\r\\nfairly answered by another, since it is impossible to oppose allusion\\r\\nby reasoning. In accumulating facts, as in amassing riches, people\\r\\noften begin by believing that they value wealth only for the use they\\r\\nshall make of it; but it often happens, that during the course of\\r\\ntheir labours, they learn habitually to set a value upon the coin\\r\\nitself, and they grow avaricious of that which they are sensible has\\r\\nlittle intrinsic value. Young people who have accumulated a vast\\r\\nnumber of facts, and names, and dates, perhaps intended originally to\\r\\nmake some good use of their treasure; but they frequently forget their\\r\\nlaudable intentions, and conclude by contenting themselves with the\\r\\ndisplay of their nominal wealth. Pedants and misers forget the real\\r\\nuse of wealth and knowledge, and they accumulate without rendering\\r\\nwhat they acquire useful to themselves or to others.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of facts are often stored in the mind, which lie there\\r\\nuseless, because they cannot be found at the moment when they are\\r\\nwanted. It is not sufficient, therefore, in education, to store up\\r\\nknowledge; it is essential to arrange facts so that they shall be\\r\\nready for use, as materials for the imagination, or the judgment, to\\r\\nselect and combine. The power of retentive memory is exercised too\\r\\nmuch, the faculty of recollective memory is exercised too little, by\\r\\nthe common modes of education. Whilst children are reading the history\\r\\nof kings, and battles, and victories; whilst they are learning tables\\r\\nof chronology and lessons of geography by rote, their inventive and\\r\\ntheir reasoning faculties are absolutely passive; nor are any of the\\r\\nfacts which they learn in this manner, associated with circumstances\\r\\nin real life. These trains of ideas may with much pains and labour be\\r\\nfixed in the memory, but they must be recalled precisely in the order\\r\\nin which they were learnt by rote, and this is not the order in which\\r\\nthey may be wanted: they will be conjured up in technical succession,\\r\\nor in troublesome multitudes.--Many people are obliged to repeat the\\r\\nalphabet before they can recollect the relative place of any given\\r\\nletter; others repeat a column of the multiplication table before they\\r\\ncan recollect the given sum of the number they want. There is a common\\r\\nrigmarole for telling the number of days in each month in the year;\\r\\nthose who have learnt it by heart, usually repeat the whole of it\\r\\nbefore they can recollect the place of the month which they want; and\\r\\nsometimes in running over the lines, people miss the very month which\\r\\nthey are thinking of, or repeat its name without perceiving that they\\r\\nhave named it. In the same manner, those who have learned historical\\r\\nor chronological facts in a technical mode, must go through the whole\\r\\ntrain of their rigmarole associations before they can hit upon the\\r\\nidea which they want. Lord Bolingbroke mentions an acquaintance of\\r\\nhis, who had an amazing collection of facts in his memory, but\\r\\nunfortunately he could never produce one of them in the proper moment;\\r\\nhe was always obliged to go back to to some fixed landing place, from\\r\\nwhich he was accustomed to take his flight. Lord Bolingbroke used to\\r\\nbe afraid of asking him a question, because when once he began, he\\r\\nwent off like a larum, and could not be stopped; he poured out a\\r\\nprofusion of things which had nothing to do with the point in\\r\\nquestion; and it was ten to one but he omitted the only circumstance\\r\\nthat would have been really serviceable. Many people who have\\r\\ntenacious memories, and who have been ill educated, find themselves in\\r\\na similar condition, with much knowledge baled up, an incumbrance to\\r\\nthemselves and to their friends. The great difference which appears in\\r\\nmen of the same profession, and in the same circumstances, depends\\r\\nupon the application of their knowledge more than upon the quantity of\\r\\ntheir learning.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith respect to a knowledge of history and chronologic learning, every\\r\\nbody is now nearly upon a level; this species of information cannot be\\r\\na great distinction to any one; a display of such common knowledge, is\\r\\nconsidered by literary people, and by men of genius especially, as\\r\\nridiculous and offensive. One motive, therefore, for loading the minds\\r\\nof children with historic dates and facts, is likely, even from its\\r\\nhaving universally operated, to cease to operate in future. Without\\r\\nmaking it a laborious task to young people, it is easy to give them\\r\\nsuch a knowledge of history, as will preserve them from the shame of\\r\\nignorance, and put them upon a footing with men of good sense in\\r\\nsociety, though not, perhaps, with men who have studied history for\\r\\nthe purpose of shining in conversation. For our purpose, it is not\\r\\nnecessary early to study voluminous philosophic histories; these\\r\\nshould be preserved for a more advanced period of their education. The\\r\\nfirst thing to be done, is to seize the moment when curiosity is\\r\\nexcited by the accidental mention of any historic name or event. When\\r\\na child hears his father talk of the Roman emperors, or of the Roman\\r\\npeople, he naturally inquires who these people were; some short\\r\\nexplanation may be given, so as to leave curiosity yet unsatisfied.\\r\\nThe prints of the Roman emperors\\' heads, and Mrs. Trimmer\\'s prints of\\r\\nthe remarkable events in the Roman and English history, will entertain\\r\\nchildren. Madame de Silleri, in her Adela and Theodore, describes\\r\\nhistorical hangings, which she found advantageous to her pupils. In a\\r\\nprince\\'s palace, or a nobleman\\'s palace, such hangings would be\\r\\nsuitable decorations, or in a public seminary of education it would be\\r\\nworth while to prepare them: private families would, perhaps, be\\r\\nalarmed at the idea of expense, and at the idea, that their house\\r\\ncould not readily be furnished in proper time for the instruction of\\r\\nchildren. As we know the effect of such apprehensions of difficulty,\\r\\nwe forbear from insisting upon historical hangings, especially as we\\r\\nthink that children should not, by any great apparatus for teaching\\r\\nthem history, be induced to set an exorbitant value upon this sort of\\r\\nknowledge, and should hence be excited to cultivate their memories\\r\\nwithout reasoning or reflecting. If any expedients are thought\\r\\nnecessary to fix historic facts early in the mind, the entertaining\\r\\ndisplay of Roman emperors, and British kings and queens, may be made,\\r\\nas madame de Silleri recommends, in a magic lantern, or by the Ombres\\r\\nChinoises. When these are exhibited, there should be some care taken\\r\\nnot to introduce any false ideas. Parents should be present at the\\r\\nspectacle, and should answer each eager question with prudence. \"Ha!\\r\\nhere comes queen Elizabeth!\" exclaims the child; \"was she a good\\r\\nwoman?\" A foolish show-man would answer, \"Yes, master, she was the\\r\\ngreatest queen that ever sat upon the English throne!\" A sensible\\r\\nmother would reply, \"My dear, I cannot answer that question; you will\\r\\nread her history yourself, you will judge by her actions, whether she\\r\\nwas, or was not, a good woman.\" Children are often extremely impatient\\r\\nto settle the precise merit and demerit of every historical personage,\\r\\nwith whose names they become acquainted; but this impatience should\\r\\nnot be gratified by the short method of referring to the characters\\r\\ngiven of these persons in any common historical abridgment. We should\\r\\nadvise all such characters to be omitted in books for children; let\\r\\nthose who read, form a judgment for themselves: this will do more\\r\\nservice to the understanding, than can be done by learning by rote the\\r\\nopinion of any historian. The good and bad qualities; the decisive,\\r\\nyet contradictory, epithets, are so jumbled together in these\\r\\ncharacters, that no distinct notion can be left in the reader\\'s mind;\\r\\nand the same words recur so frequently in the characters of different\\r\\nkings, that they are read over in a monotonous voice, as mere\\r\\nconcluding sentences, which come of course, at the end of every reign.\\r\\n\"King Henry the Fifth, was tall and slender, with a long neck,\\r\\nengaging aspect, and limbs of the most elegant turn. **********. His\\r\\nvalour was such as no danger could startle, and no difficulty could\\r\\noppose. He managed the dissentions amongst his enemies with such\\r\\naddress as spoke him consummate in the arts of the cabinet. He was\\r\\nchaste, temperate, modest, and devout, scrupulously just in his\\r\\nadministration, and severely exact in the discipline of his army, upon\\r\\nwhich he knew his glory and success in a great measure depended. In a\\r\\nword, it must be owned that he was without an equal in the arts of\\r\\nwar, policy, and government. His great qualities were, however,\\r\\nsomewhat obscured by his ambition, and his natural propensity to\\r\\ncruelty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it possible that a child of seven or eight years old can acquire\\r\\nany distinct, or any just ideas, from the perusal of this character of\\r\\nHenry the fifth? Yet it is selected as one of the best drawn\\r\\ncharacters from a little abridgment of the history of England, which\\r\\nis, in general, as well done as any we have seen. Even the least\\r\\nexceptionable historic abridgments require the corrections of a\\r\\npatient parent. In abridgments for children, the facts are usually\\r\\ninterspersed with what the authors intend for moral reflections, and\\r\\neasy explanations of political events, which are meant to be suited\\r\\nto _the meanest capacities_. These reflections and explanations do\\r\\nmuch harm; they instil prejudice, and they accustom the young\\r\\nunsuspicious reader to swallow absurd reasoning, merely because it is\\r\\noften presented to him. If no history can be found entirely free from\\r\\nthese defects, and if it be even impossible to correct any completely,\\r\\nwithout writing the whole over again, yet much may be done by those\\r\\nwho hear children read. Explanations can be given at the moment when\\r\\nthe difficulties occur. When the young reader pauses to think, allow\\r\\nhim to think, and suffer him to question the assertions which he meets\\r\\nwith in books, with freedom, and that minute accuracy which is only\\r\\ntiresome to those who cannot reason. The simple morality of childhood\\r\\nis continually puzzled and shocked at the representation of the crimes\\r\\nand the virtues of historic heroes. History, when divested of the\\r\\ngraces of eloquence, and of that veil which the imagination is taught\\r\\nto throw over antiquity, presents a disgusting, terrible list of\\r\\ncrimes and calamities: murders, assassinations, battles, revolutions,\\r\\nare the memorable events of history. The love of glory atones for\\r\\nmilitary barbarity; treachery and fraud are frequently dignified with\\r\\nthe names of prudence and policy; and the historian, desirous to\\r\\nappear moral and sentimental, yet compelled to produce facts, makes\\r\\nout an inconsistent, ambiguous system of morality. A judicious and\\r\\nhonest preceptor will not, however, imitate the false tenderness of\\r\\nthe historian for the dead; he will rather consider what is most\\r\\nadvantageous to the living; he will perceive, that it is of more\\r\\nconsequence that his pupils should have distinct notions of right and\\r\\nwrong, than that they should have perfectly by rote all the Grecian,\\r\\nRoman, English, French, all the fifty volumes of the Universal\\r\\nHistory. A preceptor will not surely attempt, by any sophistry, to\\r\\njustify the crimes which sometimes obtain the name of heroism; when\\r\\nhis ingenious indignant pupil verifies the astonishing numeration of\\r\\nthe hundreds and thousands that were put to death by a conqueror, or\\r\\nthat fell in one battle, he will allow this astonishment and\\r\\nindignation to be just, and he will rejoice that it is strongly felt\\r\\nand expressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the false characters which are sometimes drawn of individuals\\r\\nin history, national characters are often decidedly given in a few\\r\\nepithets, which prejudice the mind, and convey no real information.\\r\\nCan a child learn any thing but national prepossession, from reading\\r\\nin a character of the English nation, that \"boys, before they can\\r\\nspeak, discover that they know the proper guards in boxing with their\\r\\nfists; a quality that, perhaps, is peculiar to the English, and is\\r\\nseconded by a strength of arm that few other people can exert? _This_\\r\\ngives their soldiers an infinite superiority in all battles that are\\r\\nto be decided by the bayonet screwed upon the musket.\"[112] Why should\\r\\nchildren be told, that the Italians are _naturally_ revengeful; the\\r\\nFrench _naturally_ vain and perfidious, excessively credulous and\\r\\nlitigious; that the Spaniards are _naturally_ jealous and\\r\\nhaughty?[113] The patriotism of an enlarged and generous mind cannot,\\r\\nsurely, depend upon the early contempt inspired for foreign\\r\\nnations.--We do not speak of the education necessary for naval and\\r\\nmilitary men--with this we have nothing to do; but surely it cannot be\\r\\nnecessary to teach national prejudices to any other class of young\\r\\nmen. If these prejudices are ridiculed by sensible parents, children\\r\\nwill not be misled by partial authors; general assertions will be of\\r\\nlittle consequence to those who are taught to reason; they will not be\\r\\noverawed by nonsense wherever they may meet with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words whig and tory, occur frequently in English history, and\\r\\nliberty and tyranny are talked of--the influence of the crown--the\\r\\nrights of the people. What are children of eight or nine years old to\\r\\nunderstand by these expressions? and how can a tutor explain them,\\r\\nwithout inspiring political prejudices? We do not mean here to enter\\r\\ninto any political discussion; we think, that children should not be\\r\\ntaught the principles of their preceptors, whatever they may be; they\\r\\nshould judge for themselves, and, until they are able to judge, all\\r\\ndiscussion, all explanations, should be scrupulously avoided. Whilst\\r\\nthey are children, the plainest chronicles are for them the best\\r\\nhistories, because they express no political tenets and dogmas. When\\r\\nour pupils grow up, at whatever age they may be capable of\\r\\nunderstanding them, the best authors who have written on each side of\\r\\nthe question, the best works, without any party considerations, should\\r\\nbe put into their hands; and let them form their own opinions from\\r\\nfacts and arguments, uninfluenced by passion, and uncontrolled by\\r\\nauthority.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs young people increase their collection of historic facts, some\\r\\narrangement will be necessary to preserve these in proper order in the\\r\\nmemory. Priestley\\'s Biographical Chart, is an extremely ingenious\\r\\ncontrivance for this purpose; it should hang up in the room where\\r\\nchildren read, or rather where they live, for we hope no room will\\r\\never be dismally consecrated to their studies. Whenever they hear any\\r\\ncelebrated name mentioned, or when they meet with any in books, they\\r\\nwill run to search for these names in the biographical chart; and\\r\\nthose who are used to children, will perceive, that the pleasure of\\r\\nthis search, and the joy of the discovery, will fix biography and\\r\\nchronology easily in their memories. Mortimer\\'s Student\\'s Dictionary,\\r\\nand Brookes\\'s Gazetteer, should, in a library or room which children\\r\\nusually inhabit, be always within the reach of children. If they are\\r\\nalways consulted at the very moment they are wanted, much may be\\r\\nlearned from them; but if there be any difficulty in getting at these\\r\\ndictionaries, children forget, and lose all interest in the things\\r\\nwhich they wanted to know. But if knowledge becomes immediately\\r\\nuseful, or entertaining to them, there is no danger of their\\r\\nforgetting. Who ever forgets Shakespeare\\'s historical plays? The\\r\\narrangements contrived and executed by others, do not always fix\\r\\nthings so firmly in our remembrance, as those which we have had some\\r\\nshare in contriving and executing ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of our pupils has drawn out a biographical chart upon the plan of\\r\\nPriestley\\'s, inserting such names only as he was well acquainted with;\\r\\nhe found, that in drawing out this chart, a great portion of general\\r\\nhistory and biography was fixed in his memory. Charts, in the form of\\r\\nPriestley\\'s, but without the names of the heroes, &c. being inserted,\\r\\nwould, perhaps, be useful for schools and private families.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two French historical works, which we wish were well\\r\\ntranslated for the advantage of those who do not understand French.\\r\\nThe chevalier Meheghan\\'s Tableau de l\\'Histoire Moderne, which is\\r\\nsensibly divided into epochs; and Condillac\\'s View of Universal\\r\\nHistory, comprised in five volumes, in his \"Cours d\\'Etude pour\\r\\nl\\'Instruction du Prince de Parme.\" This history carries on, along with\\r\\nthe records of wars and revolutions, the history of the progress of\\r\\nthe human mind, of arts, and sciences; the view of the different\\r\\ngovernments of Europe, is full and concise; no prejudices are\\r\\ninstilled; yet the manly and rational eloquence of virtue, gives life\\r\\nand spirit to the work. The concluding address, from the preceptor to\\r\\nhis royal pupil, is written with all the enlightened energy of a man\\r\\nof truth and genius. We do not recommend Condillac\\'s history as an\\r\\nelementary work; for this it is by no means fit; but it is one of the\\r\\nbest histories that a young man of fifteen or sixteen can read.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is scarcely possible to conceive, that several treatises on\\r\\ngrammar, the art of reasoning, thinking, and writing, which are\\r\\ncontained in M. Condillac\\'s course of study, were designed by him for\\r\\nelementary books, for the instruction of a child from seven to ten\\r\\nyears old. It appears the more surprising that the abb\\xc3\\xa9 should have\\r\\nso far mistaken the capacity of childhood, because, in his judicious\\r\\npreface, he seems fully sensible of the danger of premature\\r\\ncultivation, and of the absurdity of substituting a knowledge of words\\r\\nfor a knowledge of things. As M. Condillac\\'s is a work of high\\r\\nreputation, we may be allowed to make a few remarks on its practical\\r\\nutility, and this may, perhaps, afford us an opportunity of explaining\\r\\nour ideas upon the use of metaphysical, poetical, and critical works,\\r\\nin early education. We do not mean any invidious criticism upon\\r\\nCondillac, but in \"Practical Education\" we wish to take our examples\\r\\nand illustrations from real life. The abb\\xc3\\xa9\\'s course of study, for a\\r\\nboy of seven years old, begins with metaphysics. In his preface he\\r\\nasserts, that the arts of speaking, reasoning, and writing, differ\\r\\nfrom one another only in degrees of accuracy, and in the more or less\\r\\nperfect connection of ideas. He observes, that attention to the manner\\r\\nin which we acquire, and in which we arrange our knowledge, is\\r\\nnecessary equally to those who would learn, and to those who would\\r\\nteach, with success. These remarks are just; but does not he draw an\\r\\nerroneous conclusion from his own principles, when he infers, that the\\r\\nfirst lessons which we should teach a child, ought to be metaphysical?\\r\\nHe has given us an abstract of those which he calls preliminary\\r\\nlessons, on the operations of the soul, on attention, judgment,\\r\\nimagination, &c.--he adds, that he thought it useless to give to the\\r\\npublic the conversations and explanations which he had with his pupil\\r\\non these subjects. Both parents and children must regret the\\r\\nsuppression of these explanatory notes; as the lessons appear at\\r\\npresent, no child of seven years old can understand, and few\\r\\npreceptors can or will make them what they ought to be. In the first\\r\\nlesson on the different species of ideas, the abb\\xc3\\xa9 says,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The idea, for instance, which I have of Peter, is singular, or\\r\\nindividual; and as the idea of man is general relatively to the ideas\\r\\nof a nobleman and a citizen, it is particular as it relates to the\\r\\nidea of animal.\"[114]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Relatively to the ideas of a nobleman and a citizen.\" What a long\\r\\nexplanation upon these words there must have been between the abb\\xc3\\xa9 and\\r\\nthe prince! The whole view of society must have been opened at once,\\r\\nor the prince must have swallowed prejudices and metaphysics together.\\r\\nTo make these things familiar to a child, Condillac says, that we must\\r\\nbring a few or many examples; but where shall we find examples? Where\\r\\nshall we find proper words to express to a child ideas of political\\r\\nrelations mingled with metaphysical subtleties?\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough this whole chapter, on particular and general ideas, the abb\\xc3\\xa9\\r\\nis secretly intent upon a dispute began or revived in the thirteenth\\r\\ncentury, and not yet finished, between the Nominalists and the\\r\\nRealists; but a child knows nothing of this.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the article \"On the Power of Thinking,\" an article which he\\r\\nacknowledges to be a little difficult, he observes, that the great\\r\\npoint is to make the child comprehend what is meant by attention; \"for\\r\\nas soon as he understands that, all the rest,\" he assures us, \"will be\\r\\neasy.\" Is it then of less consequence, that the child should learn the\\r\\nhabit of attention, than that he should learn the meaning of the word?\\r\\nGranting, however, that the definition of this word is of consequence,\\r\\nthat definition should be made proportionably clear. The tutor, at\\r\\nleast, must understand it, before he can hope to explain it to his\\r\\npupil. Here it is:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"*** when amongst many sensations which you experience at the same\\r\\ntime, _the direction of the organs_ makes you take notice of one, so\\r\\nthat you do not observe the others any longer, this sensation becomes\\r\\nwhat we call _attention_.\"[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not accurate; it is not clear whether the direction of the\\r\\norgans be the cause, or the effect, of attention; or whether it be\\r\\nonly a concomitant of the sensation. Attention, we know, can be\\r\\nexercised upon abstract ideas; for this objection M. Condillac has\\r\\nafterwards a provisional clause, but the original definition remains\\r\\ndefective, because the direction of the organs is not, though it be\\r\\nstated as such, essential: besides, we are told only, that the\\r\\nsensation described becomes (devient) what we call attention. What\\r\\nattention actually is, we are still left to discover. The matter is\\r\\nmade yet more difficult; for when we are just fixed in the belief,\\r\\nthat attention depends \"upon our remarking one sensation, and not\\r\\nremarking others which we may have at the same time,\" we are in the\\r\\nnext chapter given to understand, that \"in comparison we may have _a\\r\\ndouble attention, or two attentions_, which are only two sensations,\\r\\nwhich make themselves be taken notice of equally, and consequently\\r\\ncomparison consists only of sensations.\"[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctrine of simultaneous ideas here glides in, and we concede\\r\\nunawares all that is necessary to the abb\\xc3\\xa9\\'s favourite system, \"that\\r\\nsensation becomes successively attention, memory, comparison,\\r\\njudgment, and reflection;[117] and that the art of reasoning is\\r\\nreducible to a series of identic propositions.\" Without, at present,\\r\\nattempting to examine this system, we may observe, that in education\\r\\nit is more necessary to preserve the mind from prejudice, than to\\r\\nprepare it for the adoption of any system. Those who have attended to\\r\\nmetaphysical proceedings, know, that if a few apparently trifling\\r\\nconcessions be made in the beginning of the business, a man of\\r\\ningenuity may force us, in the end, to acknowledge whatever he\\r\\npleases. It is impossible that a child can foresee these consequences,\\r\\nnor is it probable that he should have paid such accurate attention to\\r\\nthe operations of his own mind, as to be able to detect the fallacy,\\r\\nor to feel the truth, of his tutor\\'s assertions. A metaphysical\\r\\ncatechism may readily be taught to children; they may learn to answer\\r\\nalmost as readily as Trenck answered in his sleep to the guards who\\r\\nregularly called to him every night at midnight. Children may answer\\r\\nexpertly to the questions, \"What is attention? What is memory? What is\\r\\nimagination? What is the difference between wit and judgment? How many\\r\\nsorts of ideas have you, and which are they?\" But when they are\\r\\nperfect in their responses to all these questions, how much are they\\r\\nadvanced in real knowledge?\\r\\n\\r\\nAllegory has mixed with metaphysics almost as much as with poetry;\\r\\npersonifications of memory and imagination are familiar to us; to each\\r\\nhave been addressed odes and sonnets, so that we almost believe in\\r\\ntheir individual existence, or at least we are become jealous of the\\r\\nseparate attributes of these ideal beings. This metaphysical mythology\\r\\nmay be ingenious and elegant, but it is better adapted to the\\r\\npleasures of poetry than to the purposes of reasoning. Those who have\\r\\nbeen accustomed to respect and believe in it, will find it difficult\\r\\nsoberly to examine any argument upon abstract subjects; their\\r\\nfavourite prejudices will retard them when they attempt to advance in\\r\\nthe art of reasoning. All accurate metaphysical reasoners have\\r\\nperceived, and deplored, the difficulties which the prepossessions of\\r\\neducation have thrown in their way; and they have been obliged to\\r\\nwaste their time and powers in fruitless attempts to vanquish these in\\r\\ntheir own minds, or in those of their readers. Can we wish in\\r\\neducation to perpetuate similar errors, and to transmit to another\\r\\ngeneration the same artificial imbecility? Or can we avoid these\\r\\nevils, if with our present habits of thinking and speaking, we attempt\\r\\nto teach metaphysics to children of seven years old?\\r\\n\\r\\nA well educated, intelligent young man, accustomed to accurate\\r\\nreasoning, yet brought up without any metaphysical prejudices, would\\r\\nbe a treasure to a metaphysician to cross examine: he would be eager\\r\\nto hear the unprejudiced youth\\'s evidence, as the monarch, who had\\r\\nordered a child to be shut up, without hearing one word of any human\\r\\nlanguage, from infancy to manhood, was impatient to hear what would be\\r\\nthe first word that he uttered. But though we wish extremely well to\\r\\nthe experiments of metaphysicians, we are more intent upon the\\r\\nadvantage which our unprejudiced pupils would themselves derive from\\r\\ntheir judicious education: probably they would, coming fresh to the\\r\\nsubject, make some discoveries in the science of metaphysics: they\\r\\nwould have no paces[118] to show; perhaps they might advance a step or\\r\\ntwo on this difficult ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we object to the early initiation of novices into metaphysical\\r\\nmysteries, we only recommend it to preceptors not to teach; let pupils\\r\\nlearn whatever they please, or whatever they can, without reading any\\r\\nmetaphysical books, and without hearing any opinions, or learning any\\r\\ndefinitions by rote; children may reflect upon their own feelings, and\\r\\nthey should be encouraged to make accurate observations upon their own\\r\\nminds. Sensible children will soon, for instance, observe the effect\\r\\nof habit, which enables them to repeat actions with ease and facility,\\r\\nwhich they have frequently performed. The association of ideas, as it\\r\\nassists them to remember particular things, will soon be noticed,\\r\\nthough not, perhaps, in scientific words. The use of the association\\r\\nof pain or pleasure, in the form of what we call reward and\\r\\npunishment, may probably be early perceived. Children will be\\r\\ndelighted with these discoveries if they are suffered to make them,\\r\\nand they will apply this knowledge in their own education. Trifling\\r\\ndaily events will recall their observations, and experience will\\r\\nconfirm, or correct, their juvenile theories. But if metaphysical\\r\\nbooks, or dogmas, are forced upon children in the form of lessons,\\r\\nthey will, as such, be learned by rote, and forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo prevent parents from expecting as much as the abb\\xc3\\xa9 Condillac does\\r\\nfrom the comprehension of pupils of six or seven years old upon\\r\\nabstract subjects, and to enable preceptors to form some idea of the\\r\\nperfect simplicity in which children, unprejudiced upon metaphysical\\r\\nquestions, would express themselves, we give the following little\\r\\ndialogues, word for word, as they passed:\\r\\n\\r\\n1780. _Father._ Where do you think?\\r\\n\\r\\n_A----._ (Six and a half years old.) In my mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Ho----._ (Five years and a half old.) In my stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Where do you feel that you are glad, or sorry?\\r\\n\\r\\n_A----._ In my stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Ho----._ In my eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ What are your senses for?\\r\\n\\r\\n_Ho----._ To know things.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout any previous conversation, Ho---- (five years and a half old)\\r\\nsaid to her mother, \"I think you will be glad my right foot is sore,\\r\\nbecause you told me I did not lean enough upon my left foot.\" This\\r\\nchild seemed, on many occasions, to have formed an accurate idea of\\r\\nthe use of punishment, considering it always as pain given to cure us\\r\\nof some fault, or to prevent us from suffering more pain in future.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril, 1792. H----, a boy nine years and three quarters old, as he was\\r\\nhammering at a work-bench, paused for a short time, and then said to\\r\\nhis sister, who was in the room with him, \"Sister, I observe that when\\r\\nI don\\'t look at my right hand when I hammer, and only think where it\\r\\nought to hit, I can hammer much better than when I look at it. I don\\'t\\r\\nknow what the reason of that is; unless it is because I think in my\\r\\nhead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_M----._ I am not sure, but I believe that we do think in our heads.\\r\\n\\r\\n_H----._ Then, perhaps, my head is divided into two parts, and that\\r\\none thinks for one arm, and one for the other; so that when I want to\\r\\nstrike with my right arm, I think where I want to hit the wood, and\\r\\nthen, without looking at it, I can move my arm in the right direction;\\r\\nas when my father is going to write, he sometimes sketches it.\\r\\n\\r\\n_M----._ What do you mean, my dear, by sketching it?\\r\\n\\r\\n_H----._ Why, when he moves his hand (flourishes) without touching the\\r\\npaper with the pen. And at first, when I want to do any thing, I\\r\\ncannot move my hand as I mean; but after being used to it, then I can\\r\\ndo much better. I don\\'t know why.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter going on hammering for some time, he stopped again, and said,\\r\\n\"There\\'s another thing I wanted to tell you. Sometimes I think to\\r\\nmyself, that it is right to think of things that are sensible, and\\r\\nthen when I want to set about thinking of things that are sensible, I\\r\\n_cannot_; I can only think of that over and over again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_M----._ You can only think of what?\\r\\n\\r\\n_H----._ Of those words. They seem to be said to me over and over\\r\\nagain, till I\\'m quite tired, \"That it is right to think of things that\\r\\nhave some sense.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe childish expressions in these remarks have not been altered,\\r\\nbecause we wished to show exactly how children at this age express\\r\\ntheir thoughts. If M. Condillac had been used to converse with\\r\\nchildren, he surely would not have expected, that any boy of seven\\r\\nyears old could have understood his definition of attention, and his\\r\\nmetaphysical preliminary lessons.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter these preliminary lessons, we have a sketch of the prince of\\r\\nParma\\'s subsequent studies. M. Condillac says, that his royal highness\\r\\n(being not yet eight years old) was now \"perfectly well acquainted\\r\\nwith the system of intellectual operations. He comprehended already\\r\\nthe production of his ideas; he saw the origin and the progress of the\\r\\nhabits which he had contracted, and he perceived how he could\\r\\nsubstitute just ideas for the false ones which had been given to him,\\r\\nand good habits instead of the bad habits which he had been suffered\\r\\nto acquire. He had become so quickly familiar with all these things,\\r\\nthat he retraced their connection without effort, quite\\r\\nplayfully.\"[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis prince must have been a prodigy! After having made him reflect\\r\\nupon his own infancy, the abb\\xc3\\xa9 judged that the infancy of the world\\r\\nwould appear to his pupil \"the most curious subject, and the most easy\\r\\nto study.\" The analogy between these two infancies seems to exist\\r\\nchiefly in words; it is not easy to gratify a child\\'s curiosity\\r\\nconcerning the infancy of the world. Extracts from L\\'Origine des Loix,\\r\\nby M. Goguet, with explanatory notes, were put into the prince\\'s\\r\\nhands, to inform him of what happened in the commencement of society.\\r\\nThese were his evening studies. In the mornings he read the French\\r\\npoets, Boileau, Moliere, Corneille, and Racine. Racine, as we are\\r\\nparticularly informed, was, in the space of one year, read over a\\r\\ndozen times. Wretched prince! Unfortunate Racine! The abb\\xc3\\xa9\\r\\nacknowledges, that at first these authors were not understood with the\\r\\nsame ease as the preliminary lessons had been: every word stopped the\\r\\nprince, and it seemed as if every line were written in an unknown\\r\\nlanguage. This is not surprising, for how is it possible that a boy\\r\\nof seven or eight years old, who could know nothing of life and\\r\\nmanners, could taste the wit and humour of Moliere; and, incapable as\\r\\nhe must have been of sympathy with the violent passions of tragic\\r\\nheroes and heroines, how could he admire the lofty dramas of Racine?\\r\\nWe are willing to suppose, that the young prince of Parma was quick,\\r\\nand well informed for his age; but to judge of what is practicable, we\\r\\nmust produce examples from common life, instead of prodigies.\\r\\n\\r\\nS----, a boy of nine years old, of whose abilities the reader will be\\r\\nable to form some judgment from anecdotes in the following pages,\\r\\nwhose understanding was not wholy uncultivated, when he was between\\r\\nnine and ten years old, expressed a wish to read some of Shakespeare\\'s\\r\\nplays. King John was given to him. After the book had been before him\\r\\nfor one winter\\'s evening, he returned it to his father, declaring that\\r\\nhe did not understand one word of the play; he could not make out what\\r\\nthe people were about, and he did not wish to read any more of it. His\\r\\nbrother H----, at twelve years old, had made an equally ineffectual\\r\\nattempt to read Shakespeare; he was also equally decided and honest in\\r\\nexpressing his dislike to it; he was much surprised at seeing his\\r\\nsister B----, who was a year or two older than himself, reading\\r\\nShakespeare with great avidity, and he frequently asked what it was in\\r\\nthat book that could entertain her. Two years afterwards, when H----\\r\\nwas between fourteen and fifteen, he made another trial, and he found\\r\\nthat he understood the language of Shakespeare without any difficulty.\\r\\nHe read all the historical plays with the greatest eagerness, and\\r\\nparticularly seized the character of Falstaff. He gave a humorous\\r\\ndescription of the figure and dress which he supposed Sir John should\\r\\nhave, of his manner of sitting, speaking, and walking. Probably, if\\r\\nH---- had been pressed to read Shakespeare at the time when he did not\\r\\nunderstand it, he might never have read these plays with real\\r\\npleasure during his whole life. Two years increase prodigiously the\\r\\nvocabulary and the ideas of young people, and preceptors should\\r\\nconsider, that what we call literary taste, cannot be formed without a\\r\\nvariety of knowledge. The productions of our ablest writers cannot\\r\\nplease, until we are familiarized to the ideas which they contain, or\\r\\nto which they allude.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoetry is usually supposed to be well suited to the taste and capacity\\r\\nof children. In the infancy of taste and of eloquence, rhetorical\\r\\nlanguage is constantly admired; the bold expression of strong feeling,\\r\\nand the simple description of the beauties of nature, are found to\\r\\ninterest both cultivated and uncultivated minds. To understand\\r\\ndescriptive poetry, no previous knowledge is required, beyond what\\r\\ncommon observation and sympathy supply; the analogies and transitions\\r\\nof thought, are slight and obvious; no labour of attention is\\r\\ndemanded, no active effort of the mind is requisite to follow them.\\r\\nThe pleasures of simple sensation are, by descriptive poetry, recalled\\r\\nto the imagination, and we live over again our past lives without\\r\\nincreasing, and without desiring to increase, our stock of knowledge.\\r\\nIf these observations be just, there must appear many reasons, why\\r\\neven that species of poetry which they can understand, should not be\\r\\nthe early study of children; from time to time it may be an agreeable\\r\\namusement, but it should not become a part of their daily occupations.\\r\\nWe do not want to retrace perpetually in their memories a few musical\\r\\nwords, or a few simple sensations; our object is to enlarge the sphere\\r\\nof our pupil\\'s capacity, to strengthen the habits of attention, and to\\r\\nexercise all the powers of the mind. The inventive and the reasoning\\r\\nfaculties must be injured by the repetition of vague expressions, and\\r\\nof exaggerated description, with which most poetry abounds. Childhood\\r\\nis the season for observation, and those who observe accurately, will\\r\\nafterwards be able to describe accurately: but those, who merely read\\r\\ndescriptions, can present us with nothing but the pictures of\\r\\npictures. We have reason to believe, that children, who have not been\\r\\naccustomed to read a vast deal of poetry, are not, for that reason,\\r\\nless likely to excel in poetic language. The reader will judge from\\r\\nthe following explanations of Gray\\'s Hymn to Adversity, that the boy\\r\\nto whom they were addressed, was not much accustomed to read even the\\r\\nmost popular English poetry; yet this is the same child, who a few\\r\\nmonths afterwards, wrote the translation from Ovid, of the Cave of\\r\\nSleep, and who gave the extempore description of a summer\\'s evening in\\r\\ntolerably good language.\\r\\n\\r\\nJan. 1796. S---- (nine years old) learned by heart the Hymn to\\r\\nAdversity. When he came to repeat this poem, he did not repeat it\\r\\nwell, and he had it not perfectly by heart. His father suspected that\\r\\nhe did not understand it, and he examined him with some care.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ \"Purple tyrants!\" Why purple?\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ Because purple is a colour something like red and black; and\\r\\ntyrants look red and black.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ No. Kings were formerly called tyrants, and they wore purple\\r\\nrobes: the purple of the ancients is supposed to be not the colour\\r\\nwhich we call purple, but that which we call scarlet.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"When first thy sire to send on earth\\r\\n    Virtue, his darling child, design\\'d,\\r\\n    To thee he gave the heavenly birth,\\r\\n    And bade to form her infant mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen S---- was asked who was meant in these lines by \"thy sire,\" he\\r\\nfrowned terribly; but after some deliberation, he discovered that \"thy\\r\\nsire\" meant Jove, the father, or sire of Adversity: still he was\\r\\nextremely puzzled with \"the heavenly birth.\" First he thought that the\\r\\nheavenly birth was the birth of Adversity; but upon recollection, the\\r\\nheavenly birth was to be trusted to Adversity, therefore she could not\\r\\nbe trusted with the care of herself. S---- at length discovered, that\\r\\nJove must have had two daughters, and he said he supposed that Virtue\\r\\nmust have been one of these daughters, and that she must have been\\r\\nsister to Adversity, who was to be her nurse, and who was to form her\\r\\ninfant mind: he now perceived that the expression, \"Stern, rugged\\r\\nnurse,\" referred to Adversity; before this, he said, he did not know\\r\\nwho it meant, whose \"rigid lore\" was alluded to in these two lines, or\\r\\nwho bore it with patience.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Stern, rugged nurse, thy rigid lore\\r\\n    With patience many a year she bore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following stanza S---- repeated a second time, as if he did not\\r\\nunderstand it.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Scared at thy frown, terrific fly\\r\\n    Self pleasing follies, idle brood,\\r\\n    Wild laughter, noise, and thoughtless joy,\\r\\n    And leave us leisure to be good.\\r\\n    Light they disperse, and with them go\\r\\n    The summer friend, the flattering foe;\\r\\n    By vain prosperity receiv\\'d,\\r\\n    To her they vow their truth, and are again believ\\'d.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Why does the poet say _wild_ laughter?\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ It means, not reasonable.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Father._ Why is it said,\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"By vain prosperity receiv\\'d,\\r\\n    To her they vow their truth, and are again believ\\'d?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n_S----._ Because the people, I suppose, when they were in prosperity\\r\\nbefore, believed them before, but I think that seems confused.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Oh gently on thy suppliant\\'s head,\\r\\n    Dread goddess, lay thy chastening hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nS---- did not seem to comprehend the first of these two lines; and\\r\\nupon cross examination, it appeared that he did not know the meaning\\r\\nof the word _suppliant_; he thought it meant \"a person who supplies\\r\\nus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Not in thy Gorgon terrors clad,\\r\\n    Nor circled by the vengeful band,\\r\\n    As by the impious thou art seen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may appear improbable, that a child who did not know the meaning\\r\\nof the word suppliant, should understand the Gorgon terrors, and the\\r\\nvengeful band, yet it was so: S---- understood these lines distinctly;\\r\\nhe said, \"Gorgon terrors, yes, like the head of Gorgon.\" He was at\\r\\nthis time translating from Ovid\\'s Metamorphoses; and it happened that\\r\\nhis father had explained to him the ideas of the ancients concerning\\r\\nthe furies; besides this, several people in the family had been\\r\\nreading Potter\\'s \\xc3\\x86schylus, and the furies had been the subject of\\r\\nconversation. From such accidental circumstances as these, children\\r\\noften appear, in the same instant almost, to be extremely quick, and\\r\\nextremely slow of comprehension; a preceptor who is well acquainted\\r\\nwith all his pupil\\'s previous knowledge, can rapidly increase his\\r\\nstock of ideas by turning every accidental circumstance to account:\\r\\nbut if a tutor persists in forcing a child to a regular course of\\r\\nstudy, all his ideas must be collected, not as they are wanted in\\r\\nconversation or in real life, but as they are wanted to get through a\\r\\nlesson or a book. It is not surprising, that M. Condillac found such\\r\\nlong explanations necessary for his young pupil in reading the\\r\\ntragedies of Racine; he says, that he was frequently obliged to\\r\\ntranslate the poetry into prose, and frequently the prince could\\r\\ngather only some general idea of the whole drama, without\\r\\nunderstanding the parts. We cannot help regretting, that the\\r\\nexplanations have not been published for the advantage of future\\r\\npreceptors; they must have been almost as difficult as those for the\\r\\npreliminary lessons. As we are convinced that the art of education can\\r\\nbe best improved by the registering of early experiments, we are very\\r\\nwilling to expose such as have been made, without fear of fastidious\\r\\ncriticism or ridicule.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 1, 1796. A little poem, called \"The Tears of Old May-day,\"\\r\\npublished in the second volume of the World, was read to S----. Last\\r\\nMay-day the same poem had been read to him; he then liked it much,\\r\\nand his father wished to see what effect it would have upon this\\r\\nsecond reading. The pleasure of novelty was worn off, but S---- felt\\r\\nnew pleasure from his having, during the last year, acquired a great\\r\\nnumber of new ideas, and especially some knowledge of ancient\\r\\nmythology, which enabled him to understand several allusions in the\\r\\npoem which had before been unintelligible to him. He had become\\r\\nacquainted with the muses, the graces, Cynthia, Philomel, Astrea, who\\r\\nare all mentioned in this poem; he now knew something about the\\r\\nHesperian fruit, Amalthea\\'s horn, choral dances, Libyan Ammon, &c.\\r\\nwhich are alluded to in different lines of the poem: he remembered the\\r\\nexplanation which his father had given him the preceding year, of a\\r\\nline which alludes to the island of Atalantis:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Then vanished many a sea-girt isle and grove,\\r\\n    Their forests floating on the wat\\'ry plain;\\r\\n    Then famed for arts, and laws deriv\\'d from Jove,\\r\\n    My Atalantis sunk beneath the main.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nS----, whose imagination had been pleased with the idea of the\\r\\nfabulous island of Atalantis, recollected what he had heard of it; but\\r\\nhe had forgotten the explanation of another stanza of this poem, which\\r\\nhe had heard at the same time:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"To her no more Augusta\\'s wealthy pride,\\r\\n    Pours the full tribute from Potosi\\'s mine;\\r\\n    Nor fresh blown garlands village maids provide,\\r\\n    A purer offering at her rustic shrine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nS---- forgot that he had been told that London was formerly called\\r\\nAugusta; that Potosi\\'s mines contained silver; and that pouring the\\r\\ntribute from Potosi\\'s mines, alludes to the custom of hanging silver\\r\\ntankards upon the May-poles in London on May-day; consequently the\\r\\nbeauty of this stanza was entirely lost upon him. A few circumstances\\r\\nwere now told to S----, which imprinted the explanation effectually in\\r\\nhis memory: his father told him, that the publicans, or those who keep\\r\\npublic houses in London, make it a custom to lend their silver\\r\\ntankards to the poor chimney-sweepers and milk-maids, who go in\\r\\nprocession through the streets on May-day. The confidence that is put\\r\\nin the honesty of these poor people, pleased S----, and all these\\r\\ncircumstances fixed the principal idea more firmly in his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following lines could please him only by their sound, the first\\r\\ntime he heard them:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Ah! once to fame and bright dominion born,\\r\\n      The earth and smiling ocean saw me rise,\\r\\n    With time coeval, and the star of morn,\\r\\n      The first, the fairest daughter of the skies.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Then, when at heaven\\'s prolific mandate sprung\\r\\n      The radiant beam of new-created day,\\r\\n    Celestial harps, to airs of triumph strung,\\r\\n      Hail\\'d the glad dawn, and angel\\'s call\\'d me May.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"Space in her empty regions heard the sound,\\r\\n      And hills and dales, and rocks and valleys rung;\\r\\n    The sun exulted in his glorious round,\\r\\n      And shouting planets in their courses sung.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea which the ancients had of the music of the spheres was here\\r\\nexplained to S----, and some general notion was given to him of the\\r\\n_harmonic numbers_.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a number of new ideas this little poem served to introduce into\\r\\nthe mind! These explanations being given precisely at the time when\\r\\nthey were wanted, fixed the ideas in the memory in their proper\\r\\nplaces, and associated knowledge with the pleasures of poetry. Some of\\r\\nthe effect of a poem must, it is true, be lost by interruptions and\\r\\nexplanations; but we must consider the general improvement of the\\r\\nunderstanding, and not merely the cultivation of poetic taste. In the\\r\\ninstance which we have just given, the pleasure which the boy received\\r\\nfrom the poem, seemed to increase in proportion to the exactness with\\r\\nwhich it was explained. The succeeding year, on May-day 1797, the same\\r\\npoem was read to him for the third time, and he appeared to like it\\r\\nbetter than he had done upon the first reading. If, instead of\\r\\nperusing Racine twelve times in one year, the young prince of Parma\\r\\nhad read any one play or scene at different periods of his education,\\r\\nand had been led to observe the increase of pleasure which he felt\\r\\nfrom being able to understand what he read better each succeeding time\\r\\nthan before, he would probably have improved more rapidly in his taste\\r\\nfor poetry, though he might not have known Racine by rote quite so\\r\\nearly as at eight years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe considered parents almost as much as children, when we advised that\\r\\na great deal of poetry should not be read by very young pupils; the\\r\\nlabour and difficulty of explaining it can be known only to those who\\r\\nhave tried the experiment. The Elegy in a country church-yard, is one\\r\\nof the most popular poems, which is usually given to children to learn\\r\\nby heart; it cost at least a quarter of an hour to explain to\\r\\nintelligent children, the youngest of whom was at the time nine years\\r\\nold, the first stanza of that elegy. And we have heard it asserted by\\r\\na gentleman not unacquainted with literature, that perfectly to\\r\\nunderstand l\\'Allegro and Il Penseroso, requires no inconsiderable\\r\\nportion of ancient and modern knowledge. It employed several hours on\\r\\ndifferent days to read and explain Comus, so as to make it\\r\\nintelligible to a boy of ten years, who gave his utmost attention to\\r\\nit. The explanations on this poem were found to be so numerous and\\r\\nintricate, that we thought it best not to produce them here.\\r\\nExplanations which are given by a reader, can be given with greater\\r\\nrapidity and effect, than any which a writer can give to children: the\\r\\nexpression of the countenance is advantageous, the sprightliness of\\r\\nconversation keeps the pupils awake, and the connection of the parts\\r\\nof the subject can be carried on better in speaking and reading, than\\r\\nit can be in written explanations. Notes are almost always too formal,\\r\\nor too obscure; they explain what was understood more plainly before\\r\\nany illustration was attempted, or they leave us in the dark the\\r\\nmoment we want to be enlightened. Wherever parents or preceptors can\\r\\nsupply the place of notes and commentators, they need not think their\\r\\ntime ill bestowed. If they cannot undertake these troublesome\\r\\nexplanations, they can surely reserve obscure poems for a later period\\r\\nof their pupil\\'s education. Children, who are taught at seven or eight\\r\\nyears old to repeat poetry, frequently get beautiful lines by rote,\\r\\nand speak them fluently, without in the least understanding the\\r\\nmeaning of the lines. The business of a poet is to please the\\r\\nimagination, and to move the passions: in proportion as his language\\r\\nis sublime or pathetic, witty or satirical, it must be unfit for\\r\\nchildren. Knowledge cannot be detailed, or accurately explained, in\\r\\npoetry; the beauty of an allusion depends frequently upon the\\r\\nelliptical mode of expression, which passing imperceptibly over all\\r\\nthe intermediate links in our associations, is apparent only when it\\r\\ntouches the ends of the chain. Those who wish to instruct, must pursue\\r\\nthe opposite system.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Doctor Wilkins\\'s Essay on Universal Language, he proposes to\\r\\nintroduce a note similar to the common note of admiration, to give the\\r\\nreader notice when any expression is used in an ironical or in a\\r\\nmetaphoric sense. Such a note would be of great advantage to children:\\r\\nin reading poetry, they are continually puzzled between the obvious\\r\\nand the metaphoric sense of the words.[121] The desire to make\\r\\nchildren learn a vast deal of poetry by heart, fortunately for the\\r\\nunderstanding of the rising generation, does not rage with such\\r\\nviolence as formerly. Dr. Johnson successfully laughed at infants\\r\\nlisping out, \"Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.\" His reproof\\r\\nwas rather ill-natured, when he begged two children who were produced,\\r\\nto repeat some lines to him, \"Can\\'t the pretty dears repeat them both\\r\\ntogether?\" But this reproof has probably prevented many exhibitions of\\r\\nthe same kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people learn poetry by heart for the pleasure of quoting it in\\r\\nconversation; but the talent for quotation, both in conversation and\\r\\nin writing, is now become so common, that it cannot confer\\r\\nimmortality.[122] Every person has by rote certain passages from\\r\\nShakespeare and Thomson, Goldsmith and Gray: these trite quotations\\r\\nfatigue the literary ear, and disgust the taste of the public. To this\\r\\nchange in the fashion of the day, those who are influenced by fashion,\\r\\nwill probably listen with more eagerness, than to all the reasons that\\r\\nhave been offered. But to return to the prince of Parma. After reading\\r\\nCorneille, Racine, Moliere, Boileau, &c. the young prince\\'s taste was\\r\\nformed, as we are assured by his preceptor, and he was now fit for the\\r\\nstudy of grammar. So much is due to the benevolent intentions of a man\\r\\nof learning and genius, who submits to the drudgery of writing an\\r\\nelementary book on grammar, that even a critic must feel unwilling to\\r\\nexamine it with severity. M. Condillac, in his attempt to write a\\r\\nrational grammar, has produced, if not a grammar fit for children, a\\r\\nphilosophical treatise, which a well educated young person will read\\r\\nwith great advantage at the age of seventeen or eighteen. All that is\\r\\nsaid of the natural language of signs, of the language of action, of\\r\\npantomimes, and of the institution of M. l\\'Abb\\xc3\\xa9 l\\'Ep\\xc3\\xa9e for teaching\\r\\nlanguages to the deaf and dumb, is not only amusing and instructive to\\r\\ngeneral readers, but, with slight alterations in the language, might\\r\\nbe perfectly adapted to the capacity of children. But when the Abb\\xc3\\xa9\\r\\nCondillac goes on to \"Your highness knows what is meant by a system,\"\\r\\nhe immediately forgets his pupils age. The reader\\'s attention is\\r\\npresently deeply engaged by an abstract disquisition on the relative\\r\\nproportion, represented by various circles of different extent, of the\\r\\nwants, ideas, and language of savages, shepherds, commercial and\\r\\npolished nations, when he is suddenly awakened to the recollection,\\r\\nthat all this is addressed to a child of eight years old: an allusion\\r\\nto the prince\\'s little chair, completely rouses us from our reverie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As your little chair is made in the same form as mine, which is\\r\\nhigher, so the system of ideas is fundamentally the same amongst\\r\\nsavage and civilized nations; it differs only in degrees of extension,\\r\\nas after one and the same model, seats of different heights have been\\r\\nmade.\"[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch mistakes as these, in a work intended for a child, are so\\r\\nobvious, that they could not have escaped the penetration of a great\\r\\nman, had he known as much of the practice as he did of the theory of\\r\\nthe art of teaching.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo analyze a thought, and to show the construction of language, M.\\r\\nCondillac, in this volume on grammar, has chosen for an example a\\r\\npassage from an _Eloge_ on Peter Corneille, pronounced before the\\r\\nFrench academy by Racine, on the reception of Thomas Corneille, who\\r\\nsucceeded to Peter. It is in the French style of academical panegyric,\\r\\na representation of the chaotic state in which Corneille found the\\r\\nFrench theatre, and of the light and order which he diffused through\\r\\nthe dramatic world by his creative genius. A subject less interesting,\\r\\nor more unintelligible to a child, could scarcely have been selected.\\r\\nThe lecture on the anatomy of Racine\\'s thought, lasts through fifteen\\r\\npages; according to all the rules of art, the dissection is ably\\r\\nperformed, but most children will turn from the operation with\\r\\ndisgust.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Abb\\xc3\\xa9 Condillac\\'s treatise on the art of writing, immediately\\r\\nsucceeds to his grammar. The examples in this volume are much better\\r\\nchosen; they are interesting to all readers; those especially from\\r\\nmadame de Sevign\\xc3\\xa9\\'s letters, which are drawn from familiar language\\r\\nand domestic life. The enumeration of the figures of speech, and the\\r\\nclassification of the flowers of rhetoric, are judiciously suppressed;\\r\\nthe catalogue of the different sorts of _turns_, phrases proper for\\r\\nmaxims and principles, turns proper for sentiment, ingenious turns and\\r\\nquaint turns, stiff turns and easy turns, might, perhaps, have been\\r\\nsomewhat abridged. The observations on the effect of unity in the\\r\\nwhole design, and in all the subordinate parts of a work, though they\\r\\nmay not be new, are ably stated; and the remark, that the utmost\\r\\npropriety of language, and the strongest effect of eloquence and\\r\\nreasoning, result from the greatest possible attention to the\\r\\nconnection of our ideas, is impressed forcibly upon the reader\\r\\nthroughout this work.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow far works of criticism in general are suited to children, remains\\r\\nto be considered. Such works cannot probably suit their taste, because\\r\\nthe taste for systematic criticism cannot arise in the mind until many\\r\\nbooks have been read; until the various species of excellence suited\\r\\nto different sorts of composition, have been perceived, and until the\\r\\nmind has made some choice of its own. It is true, that works of\\r\\ncriticism may teach children to talk well of what they read; they will\\r\\nbe enabled to repeat what good judges have said of books. But this is\\r\\nnot, or ought not to be, the object. After having been thus\\r\\nofficiously assisted by a connoisseur, who points out to them the\\r\\nbeauties of authors, will they be able afterwards to discover beauties\\r\\nwithout his assistance? Or have they as much pleasure in being told\\r\\nwhat to admire, what to praise, and what to blame, as if they had been\\r\\nsuffered to feel and to express their own feelings naturally? In\\r\\nreading an interesting play, or beautiful poem, how often has a man of\\r\\ntaste and genius execrated the impertinent commentator, who\\r\\ninterrupts him by obtruding his ostentatious notes--\"The reader will\\r\\nobserve the beauty of this thought.\" \"This is one of the finest\\r\\npassages in any author, ancient or modern.\" \"The sense of this line,\\r\\nwhich all former annotators have mistaken, is obviously restored by\\r\\nthe addition of the vowel i.\" &c.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeprived, by these anticipating explanations, of the use of his own\\r\\ncommon sense, the reader detests the critic, soon learns to disregard\\r\\nhis references, and to skip over his learned truisms. Similar\\r\\nsensations, tempered by duty or by fear, may have been sometimes\\r\\nexperienced by a vivacious child, who, eager to go on with what he is\\r\\nreading, is prevented from feeling the effect of the whole, by a\\r\\npremature discussion of its parts. We hope that no keen hunter of\\r\\nparadoxes will here exult in having detected us in a contradiction: we\\r\\nare perfectly aware, that but a few pages ago we exhibited examples of\\r\\ndetailed explanations of poetry for children; but these explanations\\r\\nwere not of the criticising class; they were not designed to tell\\r\\nyoung people what to admire, but simply to assist them to understand\\r\\nbefore they admired.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks of criticism are sometimes given to pupils, with the idea that\\r\\nthey will instruct and form them in the art of writing: but few things\\r\\ncan be more terrific or dangerous to the young writer, than the voice\\r\\nof relentless criticism. Hope stimulates, but fear depresses the\\r\\nactive powers of the mind; and how much have they to fear, who have\\r\\ncontinually before their eyes the mistakes and disgrace of others; of\\r\\nothers, who with superior talents have attempted and failed! With a\\r\\nmultitude of precepts and rules of rhetoric full in their memory, they\\r\\ncannot express the simplest of their thoughts; and to write a sentence\\r\\ncomposed of members, which have each of them names of many syllables,\\r\\nmust appear a most formidable and presumptuous undertaking. On the\\r\\ncontrary, a child who, in books and in conversation, has been used to\\r\\nhear and to speak correct language, and who has never been terrified\\r\\nwith the idea, that to write, is to express his thoughts in some new\\r\\nand extraordinary manner, will naturally write as he speaks, and as he\\r\\nthinks. Making certain characters upon paper, to represent to others\\r\\nwhat he wishes to say[124] to them, will not appear to him a matter of\\r\\ndread and danger, but of convenience and amusement, and he will write\\r\\nprose without knowing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst some \"Practical Essays,\"[125] lately published, \"to assist the\\r\\nexertions of youth in their literary pursuits,\" there is an essay on\\r\\nletter-writing, which might deter a timid child from ever undertaking\\r\\nsuch an arduous task as that of writing a letter. So much is said from\\r\\nBlair, from Cicero, from Quintilian; so many things are requisite in a\\r\\nletter; purity, neatness, simplicity; such caution must be used to\\r\\navoid \"exotics transplanted from foreign languages, or raised in the\\r\\nhot-beds of affectation and conceit;\" such attention to the\\r\\nmother-tongue is prescribed, that the young nerves of the\\r\\nletter-writer must tremble when he takes up his pen. Besides, he is\\r\\ntold that \"he should be extremely reserved on the head of pleasantry,\"\\r\\nand that \"as to sallies of wit, it is still more dangerous to let them\\r\\nfly at random; but he may repeat the smart sayings of others if he\\r\\nwill, or relate _part_ of some droll adventure, to enliven his\\r\\nletter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe anxiety that parents and tutors frequently express, to have their\\r\\nchildren write letters, and good letters, often prevents the pupils\\r\\nfrom writing during the whole course of their lives. Letter-writing\\r\\nbecomes a task and an evil to children; whether they have any thing to\\r\\nsay or not, write they must, this post or next, without fail, _a\\r\\npretty letter_ to some relation or friend, who has exacted from them\\r\\nthe awful promise of punctual correspondence. It is no wonder that\\r\\nschool-boys and school-girls, in these circumstances, feel that\\r\\nnecessity is _not_ the mother of invention; they are reduced to the\\r\\nhumiliating misery of begging from some old practitioner a beginning,\\r\\nor an ending, and something to say to fill up the middle.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocke humorously describes the misery of a school-boy who is to write\\r\\na theme; and having nothing to say, goes about with the usual petition\\r\\nin these cases to his companions, \"Pray give me a little sense.\" Would\\r\\nit not be better to wait until children have sense, before we exact\\r\\nfrom them themes and discourses upon literary subjects? There is no\\r\\ndanger, that those who acquire a variety of knowledge and numerous\\r\\nideas, should not be able to find words to express them; but those who\\r\\nare compelled to find words before they have ideas, are in a\\r\\nmelancholy situation. To form a style, is but a vague idea; practice\\r\\nin composition, will certainly confer ease in writing, upon those who\\r\\nwrite when their minds are full of ideas; but the practice of sitting\\r\\nwith a melancholy face, with pen in hand, waiting for inspiration,\\r\\nwill not much advance the pupil in the art of writing. We should not\\r\\nrecommend it to a preceptor to require regular themes at stated\\r\\nperiods from his pupils; but whenever he perceives that a young man is\\r\\nstruck with any new ideas, or new circumstances, when he is certain\\r\\nthat his pupil has acquired a fund of knowledge, when he finds in\\r\\nconversation that words flow readily upon certain subjects, he may,\\r\\nwithout danger, upon these subjects, excite his pupil to try his\\r\\npowers of writing. These trials need not be frequently made: when a\\r\\nyoung man has once acquired confidence in himself as a writer, he will\\r\\ncertainly use his talent whenever proper occasions present themselves.\\r\\nThe perusal of the best authors in the English language, will give\\r\\nhim, if he adhere to these alone, sufficient powers of expression. The\\r\\nbest authors in the English language are so well known, that it would\\r\\nbe useless to enumerate them. Dr. Johnson says, that whoever would\\r\\nacquire a pure English style, must give his days and nights to\\r\\nAddison. We do not, however, feel this exclusive preference for\\r\\nAddison\\'s melodious periods; his page is ever elegant, but sometimes\\r\\nit is too diffuse.--Hume, Blackstone, and Smith, have a proper degree\\r\\nof strength and energy combined with their elegance. Gibbon says, that\\r\\nthe perfect composition and well turned periods of Dr. Robertson,\\r\\nexcited his hopes, that he might one day become his equal in writing;\\r\\nbut \"the calm philosophy, the careless inimitable beauties of his\\r\\nfriend and rival Hume, often forced him to close the volume with a\\r\\nmixed sensation of delight and despair.\" From this testimony we may\\r\\njudge, that a simple style appears to the best judges to be more\\r\\ndifficult to attain, and more desirable, than that highly ornamented\\r\\ndiction to which writers of inferior taste aspire. Gibbon tells us,\\r\\nwith great candour, that his friend Hume advised him to beware of the\\r\\nrhetorical style of French eloquence. Hume observed, that the English\\r\\nlanguage, and English taste, do not admit of this profusion of\\r\\nornament.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout meaning to enter at large into the subject, we have offered\\r\\nthese remarks upon style for the advantage of those who are to direct\\r\\nthe taste of young readers; what they admire when they read, they will\\r\\nprobably imitate when they write. We objected to works of criticism\\r\\nfor young children, but we should observe, that at a later period of\\r\\neducation, they will be found highly advantageous. It would be absurd\\r\\nto mark the precise age at which Blair\\'s Lectures, or Condillac\\'s Art\\r\\nd\\'Ecrire, ought to be read, because this should be decided by\\r\\ncircumstances; by the progress of the pupils in literature, and by the\\r\\nsubjects to which their attention happens to have turned. Of these,\\r\\npreceptors, and the pupils themselves, must be the most competent\\r\\njudges. From the same wish to avoid all pedantic attempts to dictate,\\r\\nwe have not given any regular course of study in this chapter. Many\\r\\nable writers have laid down extensive plans of study, and have named\\r\\nthe books that are essential to the acquisition of different branches\\r\\nof knowledge. Amongst others we may refer to Dr. Priestley\\'s, which is\\r\\nto be seen at the end of his Essays on Education. We are sensible that\\r\\norder is necessary in reading, but we cannot think that the same order\\r\\nwill suit all minds, nor do we imagine that a young person cannot\\r\\nread to advantage unless he pursue a given course of study. Men of\\r\\nsense will not be intolerant in their love of learned order.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf parents would keep an accurate list of the books which their\\r\\nchildren read, of the ages at which they are read, it would be of\\r\\nessential service in improving the art of education. We might then\\r\\nmark the progress of the understanding with accuracy, and discover,\\r\\nwith some degree of certainty, the circumstances on which the\\r\\nformation of the character and taste depend. Swift has given us a list\\r\\nof the books which he read during two years of his life; we can trace\\r\\nthe ideas that he acquired from them in his Laputa, and other parts of\\r\\nGulliver\\'s travels. Gibbon\\'s journal of his studies, and his account\\r\\nof universities, are very instructive to young students. So is the\\r\\nlife of Franklin, written by himself. Madame Roland has left a history\\r\\nof her education; and in the books she read in her early years, we see\\r\\nthe formation of her character. Plutarch\\'s Lives, she tells us, first\\r\\nkindled republican enthusiasm in her mind; and she regrets that, in\\r\\nforming her ideas of universal liberty, she had only a partial view of\\r\\naffairs.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\\r\\neffort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\\r\\npublic domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\ncollection.

If the second copy\\r\\nis also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further\\r\\nopportunities to fix the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.F.4.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\r\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\r\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\r\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and official\\r\\npage at http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\r\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'\n"

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We shall not imitate the invidious example of some authors, who think\r\n",
      "it necessary to destroy the edifices of others, in order to clear the\r\n",
      "way for their own. We have no peculiar system to support, and,\r\n",
      "consequently, we have no temptation to attack the theories of others;\r\n",
      "and we have chosen the title of Practical Education, to point out that\r\n",
      "we rely entirely upon practice and experience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To make any progress in the art of education, it must be patiently\r\n",
      "reduced to an experimental science: we are fully sensible of the\r\n",
      "extent and difficulty of this undertaking, and we have not the\r\n",
      "arrogance to imagine, that we have made any considerable progress in a\r\n",
      "work, which the labours of many generations may, perhaps, be\r\n",
      "insufficient to complete; but we lay before the publick the result of\r\n",
      "our experiments, and in many instances the experiments themselves. In\r\n",
      "pursuing this part of our plan, we have sometimes descended from that\r\n",
      "elevation of style, which the reader might expect in a quarto volume;\r\n",
      "we have frequently been obliged to record facts concerning children\r\n",
      "which may seem trifling, and to enter into a minuteness of detail\r\n",
      "which may appear unnecessary. No anecdotes, however, have been\r\n",
      "admitted without due deliberation; nothing has been introduced to\r\n",
      "gratify the idle curiosity of others, or to indulge our own feelings\r\n",
      "of domestic partiality.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In what we have written upon the rudiments of science, we have pursued\r\n",
      "an opposite plan; so far from attempting to teach them in detail, we\r\n",
      "refer our readers to the excellent treatises on the different branches\r\n",
      "of science, and on the various faculties of the human mind, which are\r\n",
      "to be found in every language. The chapters that we have introduced\r\n",
      "upon these subjects, are intended merely as specimens of the manner in\r\n",
      "which we think young children should be taught. We have found from\r\n",
      "experience, that an early knowledge of the first principles of science\r\n",
      "may be given in conversation, and may be insensibly acquired from the\r\n",
      "usual incidents of life: if this knowledge be carefully associated\r\n",
      "with the technical terms which common use may preserve in the memory,\r\n",
      "much of the difficulty of subsequent instruction may be avoided.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sketches we have hazarded upon these subjects, may to some appear\r\n",
      "too slight, and to others too abstruse and tedious. To those who have\r\n",
      "explored the vast mines of human knowledge, small specimens appear\r\n",
      "trifling and contemptible, whilst the less accustomed eye is somewhat\r\n",
      "dazzled and confused by the appearance even of a small collection: but\r\n",
      "to the most enlightened minds, new combinations may be suggested by a\r\n",
      "new arrangement of materials, and the curiosity and enthusiasm of the\r\n",
      "inexperienced may be awakened, and excited to accurate and laborious\r\n",
      "researches.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With respect to what is commonly called the education of the heart, we\r\n",
      "have endeavoured to suggest the easiest means of inducing useful and\r\n",
      "agreeable habits, well regulated sympathy and benevolent affections. A\r\n",
      "witty writer says, \"Il est permis d'ennuyer en moralites d'ici jusqu'\r\n",
      "a Constantinople.\" Unwilling to avail ourselves of this permission, we\r\n",
      "have sedulously avoided declamation, and, wherever we have been\r\n",
      "obliged to repeat ancient maxims, and common truths, we have at least\r\n",
      "thought it becoming to present them in a new dress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On religion and politics we have been silent, because we have no\r\n",
      "ambition to gain partisans, or to make proselytes, and because we do\r\n",
      "not address ourselves exclusively to any sect or to any party. The\r\n",
      "scrutinizing eye of criticism, in looking over our table of contents,\r\n",
      "will also, probably, observe that there are no chapters on courage and\r\n",
      "chastity. To pretend to teach courage to Britons, would be as\r\n",
      "ridiculous as it is unnecessary; and, except amongst those who are\r\n",
      "exposed to the contagion of foreign manners, we may boast of the\r\n",
      "superior delicacy of our fair countrywomen; a delicacy acquired from\r\n",
      "domestic example, and confirmed by publick approbation. Our opinions\r\n",
      "concerning the female character and understanding, have been fully\r\n",
      "detailed in a former publication;[1] and, unwilling to fatigue by\r\n",
      "repetition, we have touched but slightly upon these subjects in our\r\n",
      "chapters on Temper, Female Accomplishments, Prudence, and Economy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We have warned our readers not to expect from us any new theory of\r\n",
      "education, but they need not apprehend that we have written without\r\n",
      "method, or that we have thrown before them a heap of desultory remarks\r\n",
      "and experiments, which lead to no general conclusions, and which tend\r\n",
      "to the establishment of no useful principles. We assure them that we\r\n",
      "have worked upon a regular plan, and where we have failed of executing\r\n",
      "our design, it has not been for want of labour or attention. Convinced\r\n",
      "that it is the duty and the interest of all who write, to inquire what\r\n",
      "others have said and thought upon the subject of which they treat, we\r\n",
      "have examined attentively the works of others, that we might collect\r\n",
      "whatever knowledge they contain, and that we might neither arrogate\r\n",
      "inventions which do not belong to us, nor weary the public by\r\n",
      "repetition. Some useful and ingenious essays may probably have escaped\r\n",
      "our notice; but we flatter ourselves, that our readers will not find\r\n",
      "reason to accuse us of negligence, as we have perused with diligent\r\n",
      "attention every work upon education, that has obtained the sanction of\r\n",
      "time or of public approbation, and, though we have never bound\r\n",
      "ourselves to the letter, we hope that we have been faithful to the\r\n",
      "spirit, of their authors. Without incumbering ourselves with any part\r\n",
      "of their systems which has not been authorized by experience, we have\r\n",
      "steadily attempted immediately to apply to practice such of their\r\n",
      "ideas as we have thought useful; but whilst we have used the thoughts\r\n",
      "of others, we have been anxious to avoid mean plagiarism, and wherever\r\n",
      "we have borrowed, the debt has been carefully acknowledged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first hint of the chapter on Toys was received from Dr. Beddoes;\r\n",
      "the sketch of an introduction to chemistry for children was given to\r\n",
      "us by Mr. Lovell Edgeworth; and the rest of the work was resumed from\r\n",
      "a design formed and begun twenty years ago. When a book appears under\r\n",
      "the name of two authors, it is natural to inquire what share belongs\r\n",
      "to each of them. All that relates to the art of teaching to read in\r\n",
      "the chapter on Tasks, the chapters on Grammar and Classical\r\n",
      "Literature, Geography, Chronology, Arithmetic, Geometry, and\r\n",
      "Mechanics, were written by Mr. Edgeworth, and the rest of the book by\r\n",
      "Miss Edgeworth. She was encouraged and enabled to write upon this\r\n",
      "important subject, by having for many years before her eyes the\r\n",
      "conduct of a judicious mother in the education of a large family. The\r\n",
      "chapter on Obedience, was written from Mrs. Edgeworth's notes, and was\r\n",
      "exemplified by her successful practice in the management of her\r\n",
      "children; the whole manuscript was submitted to her judgment, and she\r\n",
      "revised parts of it in the last stage of a fatal disease.\r\n",

      "have bought toys enough for you; why can't you divert yourself with\r\n",
      "them, instead of breaking them to pieces?\" says a mother to her child,\r\n",

      "horses, coaches and one-horse chairs without wheels, and a nameless\r\n",
      "wreck of gilded lumber.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A child in this situation is surely more to be pitied than blamed; for\r\n",
      "is it not vain to repeat, \"Why don't you play with your playthings,\"\r\n",
      "unless they be such as he can play with, which is very seldom the\r\n",
      "case; and is it not rather unjust to be angry with him for breaking\r\n",
      "them to pieces, when he can by no other device render them subservient\r\n",
      "to his amusement? He breaks them, not from the love of mischief, but\r\n",
      "from the hatred of idleness; either he wishes to see what his\r\n",
      "playthings are made of, and how they are made; or, whether he can put\r\n",
      "them together again, if the parts be once separated. All this is\r\n",
      "perfectly innocent; and it is a pity that his love of knowledge and\r\n",
      "his spirit of activity should be repressed by the undistinguishing\r\n",
      "correction of a nursery maid, or the unceasing reproof of a French\r\n",
      "governess.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The more natural vivacity and ingenuity young people possess, the\r\n",
      "less are they likely to be amused with the toys which are usually put\r\n",
      "into their hands. They require to have things which exercise their\r\n",
      "senses or their imagination, their imitative, and inventive powers.\r\n",
      "The glaring colours, or the gilding of toys, may catch the eye, and\r\n",
      "please for a few minutes, but unless some use can be made of them,\r\n",
      "they will, and ought, to be soon discarded. A boy, who has the use of\r\n",
      "his limbs, and whose mind is untainted with prejudice, would, in all\r\n",
      "probability, prefer a substantial cart, in which he could carry weeds,\r\n",
      "earth and stones, up and down hill, to the finest frail coach and six\r\n",
      "that ever came out of a toy-shop: for what could he do with the coach\r\n",
      "after having admired, and sucked the paint, but drag it cautiously\r\n",
      "along the carpet of a drawing-room, watching the wheels, which will\r\n",
      "not turn, and seeming to sympathize with the just terrors of the lady\r\n",
      "and gentleman within, who are certain of being overturned every five\r\n",
      "minutes? When he is tired of this, perhaps, he may set about to\r\n",
      "unharness horses which were never meant to be unharnessed; or to\r\n",
      "currycomb their woollen manes and tails, which usually come off during\r\n",
      "the first attempt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That such toys are frail and useless, may, however, be considered as\r\n",
      "evils comparatively small: as long as the child has sense and courage\r\n",
      "to destroy the toys, there is no great harm done; but, in general, he\r\n",
      "is taught to set a value upon them totally independent of all ideas of\r\n",
      "utility, or of any regard to his own real feelings. Either he is\r\n",
      "conjured to take particular care of them, because they cost a great\r\n",
      "deal of money; or else he is taught to admire them as miniatures of\r\n",
      "some of the fine things on which fine people pride themselves: if no\r\n",
      "other bad consequence were to ensue, this single circumstance of his\r\n",
      "being guided in his choice by the opinion of others is dangerous.\r\n",
      "Instead of attending to his own sensations, and learning from his own\r\n",
      "experience, he acquires the habit of estimating his pleasures by the\r\n",
      "taste and judgment of those who happen to be near him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I liked the cart best,\" says the boy, \"but mamma and every body said\r\n",
      "that the coach was the prettiest; so I chose the coach.\"--Shall we\r\n",
      "wonder if the same principle afterwards governs him in the choice of\r\n",
      "\"the toys of age?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A little girl, presiding at her baby tea-table, is pleased with the\r\n",
      "notion that she is like her mamma; and, before she can have any idea\r\n",
      "of the real pleasures of conversation and society, she is confirmed in\r\n",
      "the persuasion, that tattling and visiting are some of the most\r\n",
      "enviable privileges of grown people; a set of beings whom she believes\r\n",
      "to be in possession of all the sweets of happiness.\r\n",

      "Dolls, beside the prescriptive right of ancient usage, can boast of\r\n",
      "such an able champion in Rousseau, that it requires no common share of\r\n",
      "temerity to attack them. As far as they are the means of inspiring\r\n",
      "girls with a taste for neatness in dress, and with a desire to make\r\n",
      "those things for themselves, for which women are usually dependent\r\n",
      "upon milliners, we must acknowledge their utility; but a watchful eye\r\n",
      "should be kept upon the child, to mark the first symptoms of a love of\r\n",
      "finery and fashion. It is a sensible remark of a late female writer,\r\n",
      "that whilst young people work, the mind will follow the hands, the\r\n",
      "thoughts are occupied with trifles, and the industry is stimulated by\r\n",
      "vanity.\r\n",

      "Our objections to dolls are offered with great submission and due\r\n",

      "an unfurnished baby-house might be a good toy, as it would employ\r\n",
      "little carpenters and seamstresses to fit it up; but a completely\r\n",
      "furnished baby-house proves as tiresome to a child, as a finished seat\r\n",
      "is to a young nobleman. After peeping, for in general only a peep can\r\n",
      "be had into each apartment, after being thoroughly satisfied that\r\n",
      "nothing is wanting, and that consequently there is nothing to be done,\r\n",
      "the young lady lays her doll upon the state bed, if the doll be not\r\n",

      "felicity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before dolls, baby-houses, coaches, and cups and saucers, there comes\r\n",
      "a set of toys, which are made to imitate the actions of men and women,\r\n",
      "and the notes or noises of birds and beasts. Many of these are\r\n",
      "ingenious in their construction, and happy in their effect, but that\r\n",
      "effect unfortunately is transitory. When the wooden woman has churned\r\n",
      "her hour in her empty churn; when the stiff backed man has hammered or\r\n",
      "sawed till his arms are broken, or till his employers are tired; when\r\n",
      "the gilt lamb has ba-ad, the obstinate pig squeaked, and the provoking\r\n",
      "cuckoo cried cuckoo, till no one in the house can endure the noise;\r\n",
      "what remains to be done?--Wo betide the unlucky little philosopher,\r\n",
      "who should think of inquiring why the woman churned, or how the bird\r\n",
      "cried cuckoo; for it is ten to one that in prosecuting such an\r\n",
      "inquiry, just when he is upon the eve of discovery, he snaps the wire,\r\n",
      "or perforates the bellows, and there ensue \"a death-like silence, and\r\n",
      "a dread repose.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The grief which is felt for spoiling a new plaything might be borne,\r\n",
      "if it were not increased, as it commonly is, by the reproaches of\r\n",
      "friends; much kind eloquence, upon these occasions, is frequently\r\n",
      "displayed, to bring the sufferer to a proper sense of his folly, till\r\n",
      "in due time the contrite corners of his mouth are drawn down, his wide\r\n",
      "eyes fill with tears, and, without knowing what he means, he promises\r\n",
      "never to be so silly any more. The future safety of his worthless\r\n",
      "playthings is thus purchased at the expense of his understanding,\r\n",

      "The first toys for infants should be merely such things as may be\r\n",
      "grasped without danger, and which might, by the difference of their\r\n",
      "sizes, invite comparison: round ivory or wooden sticks should be put\r\n",
      "into their little hands; by degrees they will learn to lift them to\r\n",
      "their mouths, and they will distinguish their sizes: square and\r\n",
      "circular bits of wood, balls, cubes, and triangles, with holes of\r\n",
      "different sizes made in them, to admit the sticks, should be their\r\n",

      "first months of an infant's life. To ease the pain which they feel\r\n",
      "from cutting teeth, infants generally carry to their mouths whatever\r\n",
      "they can lay their hands upon; but they soon learn to distinguish\r\n",

      "care should not degenerate into cowardice; it is better that a child\r\n",
      "should tumble down or burn its fingers, than that it should not learn\r\n",
      "the use of its limbs and its senses. We should for another reason take\r\n",
      "care to put all dangerous things effectually out of the child's reach,\r\n",
      "instead of saying perpetually, \"Take care, don't touch that!--don't do\r\n",
      "that!--let that alone!\" The child, who scarcely understands the words,\r\n",
      "and not at all the reason of these prohibitions, is frightened by the\r\n",
      "tone and countenance with which they are uttered and accompanied; and\r\n",
      "he either becomes indolent or cunning; either he desists from\r\n",
      "exertion, or seizes the moment to divert himself with forbidden\r\n",
      "objects, when the watchful eye that guards them is withdrawn. It is in\r\n",

      "every piece of furniture in the French prints of Gil Blas; in the\r\n",
      "print of the Canon at Dinner, he distinguished the knives, forks,\r\n",
      "spoons, bottles, and every thing upon the table: the dog lying upon\r\n",
      "the mat, and the bunch of keys hanging at Jacintha's girdle; he told,\r\n",
      "with much readiness, the occupation of every figure in the print, and\r\n",
      "could supply, from his imagination, what is supposed to be hidden by\r\n",
      "the foremost parts of all the objects. A child of four years old was\r\n",
      "asked, what was meant by something that was very indistinctly\r\n",
      "represented as hanging round the arm of a figure in one of the prints\r\n",
      "of the London Cries. He said it was a glove; though it had as little\r\n",
      "resemblance to a glove, as to a ribbon or a purse. When he was asked\r\n",
      "how he knew that it was a glove, he answered, \"that it ought to be a\r\n",
      "glove, because the woman had one upon her other arm, and none upon\r\n",
      "that where the thing was hanging.\" Having seen the gown of a female\r\n",
      "figure in a print hanging obliquely, the same child said, \"The wind\r\n",
      "blows that woman's gown back.\" We mention these little circumstances\r\n",
      "from real life, to show how early prints may be an amusement to\r\n",
      "children, and how quickly things unknown, are learnt by the relations\r\n",
      "which they bear to what was known before. We should at the same time\r\n",
      "observe, that children are very apt to make strange mistakes, and\r\n",
      "hasty conclusions, when they begin to reason from analogy. A child\r\n",
      "having asked what was meant by some marks in the forehead of an old\r\n",
      "man in a print; and having been told, upon some occasion, that old\r\n",
      "people were wiser than young ones, brought a print containing several\r\n",
      "figures to his mother, and told her that _one_, which he pointed to,\r\n",
      "was wiser than all the rest; upon inquiry, it was found that he had\r\n",
      "formed this notion from seeing that one figure was wrinkled, and that\r\n",
      "the others were not.\r\n",

      "Prints for children should be chosen with great care; they should\r\n",
      "represent objects which are familiar; the resemblances should be\r\n",
      "accurate, and the manners should be attended to, or at least, the\r\n",
      "general moral that is to be drawn from them. The attitude of Sephora,\r\n",
      "the boxing lady in Gil Blas, must appear unnatural to children who\r\n",
      "have not lived with termagant heroines. Perhaps, the first ideas of\r\n",
      "grace, beauty, and propriety, are considerably influenced by the first\r\n",
      "pictures and prints which please children. Sir Joshua Reynolds tells\r\n",
      "us, that he took a child with him through a room full of pictures, and\r\n",
      "that the child stopped, with signs of aversion, whenever it came to\r\n",
      "any picture of a figure in a constrained attitude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Children soon judge tolerably well of proportion in drawing, where\r\n",
      "they have been used to see the objects which are represented: but we\r\n",
      "often give them prints of objects, and of animals especially, which\r\n",
      "they have never seen, and in which no sort of proportion is observed.\r\n",
      "The common prints of animals must give children false ideas. The mouse\r\n",
      "and the elephant are nearly of the same size, and the crocodile and\r\n",
      "whale fill the same space in the page. Painters, who put figures of\r\n",
      "men amongst their buildings, give the idea of the proportionate\r\n",
      "height immediately to the eye: this is, perhaps, the best scale we can\r\n",
      "adopt; in every print for children this should be attended to. Some\r\n",
      "idea of the relative sizes of the animals they see represented would\r\n",
      "then be given, and the imagination would not be filled with chimeras.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After having been accustomed to examine prints, and to trace their\r\n",
      "resemblance to real objects, children will probably wish to try their\r\n",
      "own powers of imitation. At this moment no toy, which we could invent\r\n",
      "for them, would give them half so much pleasure as a pencil. If we put\r\n",
      "a pencil into their hands even before they are able to do any thing\r\n",
      "with it but make random marks all over a sheet of paper, it will long\r\n",
      "continue a real amusement and occupation. No matter how rude their\r\n",
      "first attempts at imitation may be; if the attention of children be\r\n",
      "occupied, our point is gained. Girls have generally one advantage at\r\n",
      "this age over boys, in the exclusive possession of the scissors: how\r\n",
      "many camels, and elephants with amazing trunks, are cut out by the\r\n",
      "industrious scissors of a busy, and therefore happy little girl,\r\n",
      "during a winter evening, which passes so heavily, and appears so\r\n",
      "immeasurably long, to the idle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Modelling in clay or wax might probably be a useful amusement about\r\n",
      "this age, if the materials were so prepared, that the children could\r\n",
      "avoid being every moment troublesome to others whilst they are at\r\n",
      "work. The making of baskets, and the weaving of sash-line, might\r\n",
      "perhaps be employment for children; with proper preparations, they\r\n",
      "might at least be occupied with these things; much, perhaps, might not\r\n",
      "be produced by their labours, but it is a great deal to give early\r\n",
      "habits of industry. Let us do what we will, every person who has ever\r\n",
      "had any experience upon the subject, must know that it is scarcely\r\n",
      "possible to provide sufficient and suitable occupations for young\r\n",
      "children: this is one of the first difficulties in education. Those\r\n",
      "who have never tried the experiment, are astonished to find it such a\r\n",
      "difficult and laborious business as it really is, to find employments\r\n",
      "for children from three to six years old. It is perhaps better, that\r\n",
      "our pupils should be entirely idle, than that they should be half\r\n",
      "employed. \"My dear, have you nothing to do?\" should be spoken in\r\n",
      "sorrow rather than in anger. When they see other people employed and\r\n",

      "range of seats for the younger children, who were not yet permitted to\r\n",
      "work; these being compelled to sit idle, and to see the busy\r\n",
      "multitude, grew extremely uneasy in their own situation, and became\r\n",

      "time to time properly contrasted with the pleasures of occupation. We\r\n",

      "with industry; and, whenever young people invent employments for\r\n",
      "themselves, they should be assisted as much as possible, and\r\n",
      "encouraged. At that age when they are apt to grow tired in half an\r\n",
      "hour of their playthings, we had better give them playthings only for\r\n",
      "a very short time, at intervals in the day; and, instead of waiting\r\n",
      "till they are tired, we should take the things away before they are\r\n",

      "mischief, to which the idle are exposed. Ingenious children are\r\n",

      "the sight of the manner in which it was constructed. Many guesses were\r\n",
      "made by all the spectators about the internal structure of the cuckoo,\r\n",
      "and the astonishment of the company was universal, when the bellows\r\n",
      "were cut open, and the simple contrivance was revealed to view;\r\n",
      "probably, more was learnt from this cuckoo, than was ever learnt from\r\n",
      "any cuckoo before. So far from being indifferent to the destruction of\r\n",

      "only a more rapid species of reasoning) depend. In drawing out a list\r\n",
      "of experiments for children, it will, therefore, be advantageous to\r\n",
      "place them in that order which will best exhibit their relative\r\n",
      "connection; and, instead of showing young people the steps of a\r\n",
      "discovery, we should frequently pause to try if they can invent. In\r\n",

      "same course of education will be found to have the same advantages.\r\n",
      "When the powers of reason have been cultivated, and the inventive\r\n",

      "Whilst our pupils occupy and amuse themselves with observation,\r\n",

      "eagerness with which young people work in wood, and brass, and iron,\r\n",
      "when tools are put into their hands at a proper age, and when their\r\n",
      "understanding has been previously taught the simple principles of\r\n",

      "mechanics, or for chemistry, to spend any of his time in his\r\n",
      "children's laboratory, or at their work-bench; but in his choice of a\r\n",
      "tutor, he may perhaps supply his own defects; and he will consider,\r\n",
      "that even by interesting himself in the daily occupations of his\r\n",

      "recommended all trials of address and dexterity, except games of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In children, as in men, a taste for gaming arises from the want of\r\n",
      "better occupation, or of proper emotion to relieve them from the pains\r\n",
      "and penalties of idleness; both the vain and indolent are prone to\r\n",
      "this taste from different causes. The idea of personal merit is\r\n",
      "insensibly connected with what is called _good luck_, and before\r\n",
      "avarice absorbs every other feeling, vanity forms no inconsiderable\r\n",
      "part of the charm which fixes such numbers to the gaming-table.\r\n",
      "Indolent persons are fond of games of chance, because they feel\r\n",
      "themselves roused agreeably from their habitual state of apathy, or\r\n",
      "because they perceive, that at these contests, without any mental\r\n",
      "exertion, they are equal, perhaps superior, to their competitors.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Happy they, who have early been inspired with a taste for science and\r\n",
      "literature! They will have a constant succession of agreeable ideas;\r\n",
      "they will find endless variety in the commonest objects which surround\r\n",
      "them; and feeling that every day of their lives they have sufficient\r\n",

      "pleasures. They who have learnt, from their own experience, a just\r\n",
      "confidence in their own powers; they who have tasted the delights of\r\n",
      "well-earned praise, will not lightly trust to _chance_, for the\r\n",
      "increase of self-approbation; nor will those pursue, with too much\r\n",
      "eagerness, the precarious triumphs of fortune, who know, that in their\r\n",
      "usual pursuits, it is in their own power to command success\r\n",
      "proportioned to their exertions. Perhaps it may be thought, that we\r\n",
      "should have deferred our eulogium upon literature till we came to\r\n",
      "speak of Tasks; but if there usually appears but little connection in\r\n",
      "a child's mind, between books and toys, this must be attributed to his\r\n",
      "having had bad books and bad toys. In the hands of a judicious\r\n",

      "conducive to his purposes, and instead of useless baubles, his pupils\r\n",

      "sorts of amusements which are advantageous; we fear that we have\r\n",

      "reasoning faculty be suspended, there is yet a power secretly working\r\n",

      "it is recalled to his memory, with the same feelings. The word Task,\r\n",
      "the first time he hears it, is an unmeaning word, but it ceases to be\r\n",
      "indifferent to him the moment he hears it pronounced in a terrible\r\n",
      "voice. \"Learn your task,\" and \"fetch your book,\" recur to his\r\n",
      "recollection with indistinct feelings of pain; and hence, without\r\n",

      "tasks; but his feelings are the last things to be considered upon this\r\n",
      "occasion; the immediate business, is to teach him to read. A new era\r\n",

      "cannot be in too great a hurry to teach them. Spelling-books,\r\n",

      "be heard of in the house but tasks; nothing is to be seen but tears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No tears! no tasks! no masters! nothing upon compulsion!\" say the\r\n",
      "opposite party in education. \"Children must be left entirely at\r\n",
      "liberty; they will learn every thing better than you can teach them;\r\n",
      "their memory must not be overloaded with trash; their reason must be\r\n",
      "left to grow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their reason will never grow, unless it be exercised, is the reply;\r\n",

      "tasks and task-masters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "as to the panic fear, which, though no argument, is a most powerful\r\n",
      "motive. We see but few examples of children so extremely stupid as not\r\n",
      "to have been able to learn to read and write between the years of\r\n",
      "three and thirteen; but we see many whose temper and whose\r\n",
      "understanding have been materially injured by premature or injudicious\r\n",
      "instruction; we see many who are disgusted, perhaps irrecoverably,\r\n",
      "with literature, whilst they are fluently reading books which they\r\n",
      "cannot comprehend, or learning words by rote, to which they affix no\r\n",
      "ideas. It is scarcely worth while to speak of the vain ambition of\r\n",
      "those who long only to have it said, that their children read sooner\r\n",
      "than those of their neighbours do; for, supposing their utmost wish to\r\n",
      "be gratified, that their son could read before the age when children\r\n",
      "commonly articulate, still the triumph must be of short duration, the\r\n",
      "fame confined to a small circle of \"foes and friends,\" and, probably,\r\n",
      "in a few years, the memory of the phenomenon would remain only with\r\n",
      "his doting grandmother. Surely, it is the use which children make of\r\n",
      "their acquirements which is of consequence, not the possessing them a\r\n",
      "few years sooner or later. A man, who, during his whole life, could\r\n",

      "counters, and coaxing, and gingerbread, or by dint of reiterated pain\r\n",
      "and terror, the names of the four-and-twenty letters of the alphabet,\r\n",
      "are, perhaps, in the course of some weeks, firmly fixed in the pupil's\r\n",
      "memory. So much the worse; all these names will disturb him, if he\r\n",
      "have common sense, and at every step must stop his progress. To begin\r\n",
      "with the vowels: each of these have several different sounds, and,\r\n",
      "consequently, ought to have several names, or different signs, to\r\n",
      "distinguish them in different circumstances. In the first lesson of\r\n",
      "the spelling book, the child begins with a-b, makes ab; b-a makes ba.\r\n",
      "The inference, if any general inference can be drawn from this lesson,\r\n",
      "is, that when _a_ comes before _b_, it has one sound, and after _b_,\r\n",
      "it has another sound; but this is contradicted by and by, and it\r\n",
      "appears that _a_ after _b_, has various sounds, as in _ball_, in\r\n",
      "_bat_, in _bare_. The letter _i_ in _fire_, is _i_, as we call it in\r\n",
      "the alphabet, but in fir, it is changed; in _pin_, it is changed\r\n",
      "again; so that the child, being ordered to affix to the same sign a\r\n",
      "variety of sounds and names, and not knowing in what circumstances to\r\n",
      "obey, and in what to disregard the contradictory injunctions imposed\r\n",

      "water out of the place where it stood, his rainbow vanished. Some\r\n",

      "water; the colours remained upon the floor. He then thought that \"it\r\n",
      "might be the water.\" He emptied the glass; the colours remained, but\r\n",
      "they were fainter. S---- immediately observed, that it was the water\r\n",

      "It appeared that he had not thought upon any of these subjects; he did\r\n",

      "it. He seemed to pass a merely animal life, occupied with sensible,\r\n",

      "made to work at any continued occupation: he would shut the door of\r\n",
      "the farm-yard five hundred times a day, but he would not reap or make\r\n",

      "business which he regularly pursued. In 1779 we visited him, and tried\r\n",
      "the following experiment. He was attended to the river by a person who\r\n",
      "emptied his buckets repeatedly after Peter had repeatedly filled them.\r\n",
      "A shilling was put before his face into one of the buckets when it was\r\n",
      "empty; he took no notice of it, but filled it with water and carried\r\n",
      "it homeward: his buckets were taken from him before he reached the\r\n",
      "house and emptied on the ground; the shilling, which had fallen out,\r\n",
      "was again shown to him, and put into the bucket. Peter returned to the\r\n",
      "river again, filled his bucket and went home; and when the bucket was\r\n",
      "emptied by the maid at the house where he lived, he took the shilling\r\n",

      "what uses it is applied in arts, manufactures, and commerce; the name\r\n",

      "on the contrary, learn all the properties, and the various uses of\r\n",
      "gold, without having learned its name; his ideas of this metal would\r\n",
      "be perfectly distinct; but whenever he wished to speak of gold, he\r\n",
      "would be obliged to use a vast deal of circumlocution to make himself\r\n",
      "understood; and if he were to enumerate all the properties of the\r\n",
      "metal every time he wanted to recal the general idea, his\r\n",
      "conversation would be intolerably tedious to others, and to himself\r\n",
      "this useless repetition must be extremely laborious. He would\r\n",
      "certainly be glad to learn that single word _gold_, which would save\r\n",
      "him so much trouble; his understanding would appear suddenly to have\r\n",
      "improved, simply from his having acquired a proper sign to represent\r\n",
      "his ideas. The boy who had learnt the name, without knowing any of the\r\n",
      "properties of gold, would also appear comparatively ignorant, as soon\r\n",
      "as it is discovered that he has few ideas annexed to the word. It is,\r\n",
      "perhaps, for this reason, that some children seem suddenly to shine\r\n",
      "out with knowledge, which no one suspected they possessed; whilst\r\n",
      "others, who had appeared to be very quick and clever, come to a dead\r\n",
      "stop in their education, and appear to be blighted by some unknown\r\n",
      "cause. The children who suddenly shine out, are those who had acquired\r\n",
      "a number of ideas, and who, the moment they acquire proper words, can\r\n",
      "communicate their thoughts to others. Those children who suddenly seem\r\n",
      "to lose their superiority, are those who had acquired a variety of\r\n",
      "words, but who had not annexed ideas to them. When their ignorance is\r\n",
      "detected, we not only despair of them, but they are apt to despair of\r\n",
      "themselves; they see their companions get before them, and they do not\r\n",
      "exactly perceive the cause of their sudden incapacity. Where we speak\r\n",
      "of sensible, visible, tangible objects, we can easily detect and\r\n",
      "remedy a child's ignorance. It is easy to discover whether he has or\r\n",
      "has not a complete notion of such a substance as gold; we can\r\n",
      "enumerate its properties, and readily point out in what his definition\r\n",
      "is defective. The substance can be easily produced for examination;\r\n",
      "most of its properties are obvious to the senses; we have nothing to\r\n",
      "do but to show them to the child, and to associate with each property\r\n",
      "its usual name; here there can be no danger of puzzling his\r\n",
      "understanding; but when we come to the explanation of words which do\r\n",
      "not represent external objects, we shall find the affair more\r\n",
      "difficult. We can make children understand the meaning of those words\r\n",
      "which are the names of simple feelings of the mind, such as surprise,\r\n",
      "joy, grief, pity; because we can either put our pupils in situations\r\n",
      "where they actually feel these sensations, and then we may associate\r\n",
      "the name with the feelings; or we may, by the example of other people,\r\n",
      "who actually suffer pain or enjoy pleasure, point out what we mean by\r\n",
      "the words joy and grief. But how shall we explain to our young pupils,\r\n",
      "a number of words which represent neither existing substances nor\r\n",
      "simple feelings, when we can neither recur to experiment nor to\r\n",
      "sympathy for assistance? How shall we explain, for instance, the words\r\n",
      "virtue, justice, benevolence, beauty, taste, &c.? To analyze our own\r\n",
      "ideas of these, is no easy task; to explain the process to a young\r\n",
      "child, is scarcely possible. Call upon any man, who has read and\r\n",
      "reflected, for a definition of virtue, the whole \"theory of moral\r\n",
      "sentiments\" rises, perhaps, to his view at once, in all its elegance;\r\n",
      "the paradoxical acumen of Mandeville, the perspicuous reasoning of\r\n",
      "Hume, the accurate metaphysics of Condillac, the persuasive eloquence\r\n",

      "child who is to understand the definition? All that a prudent person\r\n",
      "will attempt, is to give instances of different virtues; but even\r\n",
      "these, it will be difficult properly to select for a child. General\r\n",
      "terms, whether in morals or in natural philosophy, should, we\r\n",
      "apprehend, be as much as possible avoided in early education. Some\r\n",
      "people may imagine that children have improved in virtue and wisdom,\r\n",
      "when they can talk fluently of justice, and charity, and humanity;\r\n",
      "when they can read with a good emphasis any didactic compositions in\r\n",
      "verse or prose. But let any person of sober, common sense, be allowed\r\n",
      "to cross-examine these proficients, and the pretended extent of their\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In a similar manner, in the exercise of our minds upon subjects that\r\n",
      "are new to us, we generally exert more attention than is necessary or\r\n",
      "serviceable, and we consequently soon fatigue ourselves without any\r\n",
      "advantage. Children, to whom many subjects are new, are often fatigued\r\n",
      "by these overstrained and misplaced efforts. In these circumstances, a\r\n",
      "tutor should relieve the attention by introducing indifferent subjects\r\n",
      "of conversation; he can, by showing no anxiety himself, either in his\r\n",
      "manner or countenance, relieve his pupil from any apprehension of his\r\n",
      "displeasure, or of his contempt; he can represent that the object\r\n",
      "before them is not a matter of life and death; that if the child does\r\n",
      "not succeed in the first trials, he will not be disgraced in the\r\n",
      "opinion of any of his friends; that by perseverance he will certainly\r\n",

      "practised to relieve the pain of attention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dr. Darwin observes, that when we experience any disagreeable\r\n",
      "sensations, we endeavour to procure ourselves temporary relief by\r\n",
      "motions of those muscles and limbs which are most habitually obedient\r\n",
      "to our will. This observation extends to mental as well as to bodily\r\n",
      "pain; thus persons in violent grief wring their hands and convulse\r\n",
      "their countenances; those who are subject to the petty, but acute\r\n",
      "miseries of false shame, endeavour to relieve themselves by awkward\r\n",
      "gestures and continual motions. A plough-boy, when he is brought into\r\n",

      "relieve himself from the uneasy sensations of false shame, by twirling\r\n",
      "his hat upon his fingers, and by various uncouth gestures. Men who\r\n",
      "think a great deal, sometimes acquire habitual awkward gestures, to\r\n",
      "relieve the pain of intense thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When attention first becomes irksome to children, they mitigate the\r\n",
      "mental pain by wrinkling their brows, or they fidget and put\r\n",
      "themselves into strange attitudes. These odd motions, which at first\r\n",
      "are voluntary, after they have been frequently associated with certain\r\n",
      "states of mind, constantly recur involuntarily with those feelings or\r\n",
      "ideas with which they have been connected. For instance, a boy, who\r\n",
      "has been used to buckle and unbuckle his shoe, when he repeats his\r\n",
      "lesson by rote, cannot repeat his lesson without performing this\r\n",
      "operation; it becomes a sort of artificial memory, which is necessary\r\n",
      "to prompt his recollective faculty. When children have a _variety_ of\r\n",
      "tricks of this sort, they are of little consequence; but when they\r\n",
      "have acquired a few constant and habitual motions, whilst they think,\r\n",
      "or repeat, or listen, these should be attended to, and the habits\r\n",
      "should be broken, otherwise these young people will appear, when they\r\n",
      "grow up, awkward and ridiculous in their manners; and, what is worse,\r\n",
      "perhaps their thoughts and abilities will be too much in the power of\r\n",
      "external circumstances. Addison represents, with much humour, the case\r\n",
      "of a poor man who had the habit of twirling a bit of thread round his\r\n",
      "finger; the thread was accidentally broken, and the orator stood mute.\r\n",

      "We once saw a gentleman get up to speak in a public assembly, provided\r\n",
      "with a paper of notes written in pencil: during the exordium of his\r\n",

      "at the paper, he found that the words were totally obliterated; he was\r\n",
      "obliged to apologize to his audience; and, after much hesitation, sat\r\n",
      "down abashed. A father would be sorry to see his son in such a\r\n",
      "predicament.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To prevent children from acquiring such awkward tricks whilst they are\r\n",
      "thinking, we should in the first place take care not to make them\r\n",
      "attend for too long a time together, then the pain of attention will\r\n",
      "not be so violent as to compel them to use these strange modes of\r\n",
      "relief. Bodily exercise should immediately follow that entire state of\r\n",
      "rest, in which our pupils ought to keep themselves whilst they attend.\r\n",
      "The first symptoms of any awkward trick should be watched; they are\r\n",
      "easily prevented by early care from becoming habitual. If any such\r\n",
      "tricks have been acquired, and if the pupil cannot exert his attention\r\n",
      "in common, unless certain contortions are permitted, we should attempt\r\n",
      "the cure either by sudden slight bodily pain, or by a total suspension\r\n",
      "of all the employments with which these bad habits are associated. If\r\n",
      "a boy could not read without swinging his head like a pendulum, we\r\n",
      "should rather prohibit him from reading for some time, than suffer\r\n",
      "him to grow up with this ridiculous habit. But in conversation,\r\n",
      "whenever opportunities occur of telling him any thing in which he is\r\n",
      "particularly interested, we should refuse to gratify his curiosity,\r\n",
      "unless he keeps himself perfectly still. The excitement here would be\r\n",
      "sufficient to conquer the habit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whatever is connected with pain or pleasure commands our attention;\r\n",
      "but to make this general observation useful in education, we must\r\n",
      "examine what degrees of stimulus are necessary for different pupils,\r\n",
      "and in different circumstances. We have formerly observed,[18] that it\r\n",
      "is not prudent early to use violent or continual stimulus, either of a\r\n",
      "painful or a pleasurable nature, to excite children to application,\r\n",
      "because we should by an intemperate use of these, weaken the mind, and\r\n",
      "because we may with a little patience obtain all we wish without these\r\n",
      "expedients. Besides these reasons, there is another potent argument\r\n",
      "against using violent motives to excite attention; such motives\r\n",
      "frequently disturb and dissipate the very attention which they attempt\r\n",
      "to fix. If a child be threatened with severe punishment, or flattered\r\n",
      "with the promise of some delicious reward, in order to induce his\r\n",
      "performance of any particular task, he desires instantly to perform\r\n",
      "the task; but this desire will not ensure his success: unless he has\r\n",
      "previously acquired the habit of voluntary exertion, he will not be\r\n",
      "able to turn his mind from his ardent wishes, even to the means of\r\n",
      "accomplishing them. He will be in the situation of Alnaschar in the\r\n",

      "The ancient inhabitants of Minorca were said to be the best slingers\r\n",
      "in the world; when they were children, every morning what they were to\r\n",

      "throw down their breakfasts with their slings from the places where\r\n",
      "they were suspended, before they could satisfy their hunger. The\r\n",

      "explanation, prevents them from thoroughly comprehending it; they are\r\n",
      "easily disturbed by external objects when they are thinking. As they\r\n",
      "have great sensibility, their associations are strong and various;\r\n",
      "their thoughts branch off into a thousand beautiful, but useless\r\n",
      "ramifications. Whilst you are attempting to instruct them upon one\r\n",
      "subject, they are inventing, perhaps, upon another; or they are\r\n",
      "following a train of ideas suggested by something you have said, but\r\n",
      "foreign to your business. They are more pleased with the discovery of\r\n",
      "resemblances, than with discrimination of difference; the one costs\r\n",
      "them more time and attention than the other: they are apt to say witty\r\n",
      "things, and to strike out sparks of invention; but they have not\r\n",
      "commonly the patience to form exact judgments, or to bring their first\r\n",

      "that they should outstrip all competitors; but it is often seen that\r\n",
      "slower rivals reach the goal before them. The predictions formed of\r\n",
      "pupils of this temperament, vary much, according to the characters of\r\n",
      "their tutors. A slow man is provoked by their dissipated vivacity,\r\n",

      "acquainted with the manner in which his pupil goes to work, is liable\r\n",

      "repeat the words that they have heard; they often ask questions, and\r\n",
      "make observations, which seem quite foreign to the present business;\r\n",
      "but this is not always a proof that their minds are absent, or that\r\n",
      "their attention is dissipated. Their answers often appear to be far\r\n",
      "from the point, because they suppress their intermediate ideas, and\r\n",
      "give only the result of their thoughts. This may be inconvenient to\r\n",
      "those who teach them; but this habit sufficiently proves that these\r\n",
      "children are not deficient in attention. To cure them of the fault\r\n",
      "which they have, we should not accuse them falsely of another. But it\r\n",
      "may be questioned whether this be a fault; it is absolutely necessary,\r\n",
      "in many processes of the mind, to suppress a number of intermediate\r\n",

      "intermediate ideas; \"Yes, indeed, mother,\" cried he, \"H---- is not\r\n",
      "absent, because _des_, in Greek, means _the son of_ (the race of.)\r\n",
      "Tydides is the son of Tydeus, as Jackson is the son of Jack.\" In this\r\n",

      "August, 1796. L----, when he returned home, after some months absence,\r\n",
      "entertained his brothers and sisters with a new play, which he had\r\n",
      "learned at Edinburgh. He told them, that when he struck the table with\r\n",
      "his hand, every person present, was instantaneously to remain fixed in\r\n",
      "the attitudes in which they should be when the blow was given. The\r\n",
      "attitudes in which some of the little company were fixed, occasioned\r\n",
      "much diversion; but in speaking of this new play afterwards, they had\r\n",
      "no name for it. Whilst they were thinking of a name for it, H----\r\n",
      "exclaimed, \"The Gorgon!\" It was immediately agreed that this was a\r\n",
      "good name for the play, and H----, upon this occasion, was perfectly\r\n",

      "Good judges, form an accurate estimate of the abilities of those who\r\n",

      "any one can show that he also has been in Arcadia, he is sure of being\r\n",
      "well received, without producing minutes of his journey. In the same\r\n",
      "manner we should judge of children; if they arrive at certain\r\n",
      "conclusions in reasoning, we may be satisfied that they have taken all\r\n",
      "the necessary previous steps. We need not question their attention\r\n",
      "upon subjects where they give proofs of invention; they must have\r\n",
      "remembered well, or they could not invent; they must have attended\r\n",
      "well, or they could not have remembered. Nothing wearies a quick child\r\n",
      "more than to be forced slowly to retrace his own thoughts, and to\r\n",
      "repeat the words of a discourse to prove that he has listened to it. A\r\n",
      "tutor, who is slow in understanding the ideas of his vivacious pupil,\r\n",
      "gives him so much trouble and pain, that he grows silent, from finding\r\n",
      "it not worth while to speak. It is for this reason, that children\r\n",
      "appear stupid and silent, with some people, and sprightly and\r\n",
      "talkative with others. Those who hope to talk to children with any\r\n",
      "effect, must, as Rousseau observes, be able to hear as well as to\r\n",
      "speak. M. de Segrais, who was deaf, was much in the right to decline\r\n",

      "full hearing; then they will have leisure to discover that what they\r\n",
      "were in such haste to utter, was not so well worth saying as they\r\n",

      "disappointment, and then his imagination will be corrected. Let him\r\n",
      "try his own experiments, then he will be ready to try yours; and if\r\n",
      "yours succeed better than his own, you will secure his confidence.\r\n",
      "After a child has talked on for some time, till he comes to the end of\r\n",

      "attention. Proofs of any of these qualities may therefore satisfy us\r\n",
      "as to the pupil's capacity and habits of attention; we need not stand\r\n",
      "by to see the attention exercised, the things produced are sufficient\r\n",
      "evidence. Buffon tells us that he wrote his Epoques de la Nature over\r\n",
      "eighteen times before he could perfect it to his taste. The high\r\n",
      "finish of his composition is sufficient evidence to intelligent\r\n",

      "Bacon supposes, that for every disease of the mind, specific remedies\r\n",
      "might be found in appropriate studies and exercises. Thus, for\r\n",
      "\"bird-witted\" children he prescribes the study of mathematics,\r\n",
      "because, in mathematical studies, the attention must be fixed; the\r\n",
      "least intermission of thought breaks the whole chain of reasoning,\r\n",
      "their labour is lost, and they must begin their demonstration again.\r\n",
      "This principle is excellent; but to apply it advantageously, we should\r\n",
      "choose moments when a mathematical demonstration is interesting to\r\n",
      "children, else we have not sufficient motive to excite them to\r\n",
      "commence the demonstration; they will perceive, that they loose all\r\n",
      "their labour if their attention is interrupted; but how shall we make\r\n",
      "them begin to attend? There are a variety of subjects which are\r\n",
      "interesting to children, to which we may apply Bacon's principle; for\r\n",
      "instance, a child is eager to hear a story which you are going to tell\r\n",
      "him; you may exercise his attention by your manner of telling this\r\n",
      "story; you may employ with advantage the beautiful figure of speech\r\n",
      "called _suspension_: but you must take care, that the hope which is\r\n",
      "long deferred be at last gratified. The young critics will look back\r\n",
      "when your story is finished, and will examine whether their attention\r\n",
      "has been wasted, or whether all the particulars to which it was\r\n",
      "directed were essential. Though in amusing stories we recommend the\r\n",
      "figure called suspension,[25] we do not recommend its use in\r\n",

      "reasoning, until these are sufficiently familiar to his pupils. He\r\n",
      "must, however, proportion the number of his repetitions to the temper\r\n",

      "pupil understands what is said, the moment when he is master of the\r\n",
      "necessary ideas, and, consequently, the moment when repetition should\r\n",

      "The countenance, the eye, the voice, and manner of the pupil, mark\r\n",
      "this instant to an observing preceptor; but a preceptor, who is\r\n",
      "absorbed in his own ideas, will never think of looking in his pupil's\r\n",
      "face; he will go on with his routine of explanation, whilst his once\r\n",
      "lively, attentive pupil, exhibits opposite to him the picture of\r\n",
      "stupified fatigue. Quick, intelligent children, who have frequently\r\n",

      "comes across their minds, they will not scruple to amuse themselves,\r\n",
      "and will afterwards ask for a repetition of the words or ideas which\r\n",
      "they missed during this excursion of fancy. When they hear the warning\r\n",
      "advertisement of \"certainly for the last time this season,\" they will\r\n",
      "deem it time enough to attend to the performance. To cure them of this\r\n",
      "presumption in favour of our patience, and of their own superlative\r\n",
      "quickness, we should press that quickness to its utmost speed.\r\n",

      "must have rapidly turned his attention upon a variety of ideas\r\n",
      "unconnected by any former associations with the exciting\r\n",
      "motive--falling from a height--fractured skulls--certain\r\n",
      "death--impossibility of reasoning or wrestling with a madman. This was\r\n",
      "the train of thoughts which we might naturally expect to arise in such\r\n",
      "a situation, but from all these the man of presence of mind turned\r\n",
      "away his attention; he must have directed his thoughts in a contrary\r\n",
      "line: first, he must have thought of the means of saving himself, of\r\n",
      "some argument likely to persuade a madman, of some argument peculiarly\r\n",
      "suited to Lee's imagination, and applicable to his situation; he must\r\n",
      "at this moment have considered that alarming situation without\r\n",
      "thinking of his fears; for the interval in which all these ideas\r\n",
      "passed in his mind, must have been so short that he could not have had\r\n",
      "leisure to combat fear; if any of the ideas associated with that\r\n",
      "passion had interrupted his reasonings, he would not have invented his\r\n",
      "answer in time to have saved his life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We cannot foresee on what occasions presence of mind may be wanted,\r\n",
      "but we may, by education, give that general command of abstract\r\n",
      "attention, which is essential to its exercise in all circumstances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Transition of thought, the power of turning attention quickly to\r\n",
      "different subjects or employments, is another of those mental habits,\r\n",
      "which in some cases we call genius, and which in others we perceive\r\n",
      "depends entirely upon practice. A number of trials in one newspaper,\r\n",
      "upon a variety of unconnected subjects, once struck our eye, and we\r\n",
      "saw the name of a celebrated lawyer[28] as counsel in each cause. We\r\n",
      "could not help feeling involuntary admiration at that versatility of\r\n",
      "genius, which could pass from a fractional calculation about a London\r\n",
      "chaldron of coals, to the Jamaica laws of insurance; from the bargains\r\n",
      "of a citizen, to the divorce of a fine lady; from pathos to argument;\r\n",
      "from arithmetic to wit; from cross examination to eloquence. For a\r\n",
      "moment we forgot our sober principles, and ascribed all this\r\n",
      "versatility of mind to natural genius; but upon reflection we recurred\r\n",
      "to the belief, that this dexterity of intellect was not bestowed by\r\n",
      "nature. We observe in men who have no pretensions to genius, similar\r\n",
      "versatility of mind as to their usual employments. The daily\r\n",
      "occupations of Mr. Elwes's huntsman were as various and incongruous,\r\n",
      "and required as quick transitions of attention, as any that can well\r\n",
      "be imagined.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"At[29] four o'clock he milked the cows; then got breakfast for Mr.\r\n",
      "Elwes and friends; then slipping on a green coat, he hurried into the\r\n",
      "stable, saddled the horses, got the hounds out of the kennel, and away\r\n",
      "they went into the field. After the fatigues of hunting, he\r\n",
      "_refreshed_ himself, by rubbing down two or three horses as quickly as\r\n",
      "he could; then running into the house to lay the cloth, and wait at\r\n",
      "dinner; then hurrying again into the stable to feed the horses,\r\n",
      "diversified with an interlude of the cows again to milk, the dogs to\r\n",
      "feed, and eight hunters to litter down for the night.\" Mr. Elwes used\r\n",
      "to call this huntsman an idle dog, who wanted to be paid for doing\r\n",
      "nothing!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We do not mean to require any such rapid daily transitions in the\r\n",
      "exercise of attention from our pupils; but we think that much may be\r\n",
      "done to improve versatility of mind, by a judicious arrangement of\r\n",
      "their occupations. When we are tired of smelling a rose, we can smell\r\n",
      "a carnation with pleasure; and when the sense of smell is fatigued,\r\n",
      "yet we can look at the beautiful colours with delight. When we are\r\n",
      "tired of thinking upon one subject, we can attend to another; when our\r\n",
      "memory is fatigued, the exercise of the imagination entertains us; and\r\n",
      "when we are weary of reasoning, we can amuse ourselves with wit and\r\n",
      "humour. Men, who have attended much to the cultivation of their mind,\r\n",
      "seem to have felt all this, and they have kept some subordinate taste\r\n",
      "as a refreshment after their labours. Descartes went from the system\r\n",
      "of the world to his flower-garden; Galileo used to read Ariosto; and\r\n",
      "the metaphysical Dr. Clarke recovered himself from abstraction by\r\n",
      "jumping over chairs and tables. The learned and indefatigable\r\n",
      "chancellor d'Aguesseau declared, that change of employment was the\r\n",
      "only recreation he ever knew. Even Montaigne, who found his recreation\r\n",
      "in playing with his cat, educated himself better than those are\r\n",
      "educated who go from intense study to complete idleness. It has been\r\n",
      "very wisely recommended by Mr. Locke, that young people should early\r\n",
      "be taught some mechanical employment, or some agreeable art, to which\r\n",
      "they may recur for relief when they are tired by mental\r\n",
      "application.[30]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Doctor Darwin supposes that \"animal motions, or configurations of the\r\n",
      "organs of sense, constitute our ideas.[31] The fatigue, he observes,\r\n",
      "that follows a continued attention of the mind to one object, is\r\n",
      "relieved by changing the subject of our thoughts, as the continued\r\n",
      "movement of one limb is relieved by moving another in its stead.\" Dr.\r\n",
      "Darwin has further suggested a tempting subject of experiment in his\r\n",
      "theory of ocular spectra, to which we refer ingenious preceptors. Many\r\n",
      "useful experiments in education might be tried upon the principles\r\n",
      "which are there suggested. We dare not here trust ourselves to\r\n",
      "speculate upon this subject, because we are not at present provided\r\n",
      "with a sufficient number of facts to apply our theory to practice. If\r\n",
      "we could exactly discover how to arrange mental employments so as to\r\n",
      "induce actions in the antagonist faculties of the mind, we might\r\n",
      "relieve it from fatigue in the same manner as the eye is relieved by\r\n",
      "change of colour. By pursuing this idea, might we not hope to\r\n",
      "cultivate the general power of attention to a degree of perfection\r\n",
      "hitherto unknown?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We have endeavoured to show how, by different arrangements and proper\r\n",
      "excitations, a preceptor may acquire that command over the attention\r\n",
      "of his pupils, which is absolutely essential to successful\r\n",
      "instruction; but we must recollect, that when the years commonly\r\n",
      "devoted to education are over, when young people are no longer under\r\n",
      "the care of a preceptor, they will continue to feel the advantages of\r\n",
      "a command of attention, whenever they mix in the active business of\r\n",
      "life, or whenever they apply to any profession, to literature, or\r\n",
      "science. Their attention must now be entirely voluntary; they will\r\n",
      "have no tutor to excite them to exertion, no nice habitual\r\n",
      "arrangements to assist them in their daily occupations. It is of\r\n",
      "consequence, therefore, that we should substitute the power of\r\n",
      "voluntary, for the habit of associated, attention. With young children\r\n",
      "we depend upon particular associations of place, time, and manner,\r\n",
      "upon different sorts of excitement, to produce habits of employment:\r\n",
      "but as our pupils advance in their education, all these temporary\r\n",
      "excitements should be withdrawn. Some large, but distant object, some\r\n",
      "pursuit which is not to be rewarded with immediate praise, but rather\r\n",
      "with permanent advantage and esteem, should be held out to the\r\n",
      "ambition of youth. All the arrangements should be left to the pupil\r\n",
      "himself, all the difficulties should be surmounted by his own\r\n",
      "industry, and the interest he takes in his own success and\r\n",
      "improvement, will now probably be a sufficient stimulus; his\r\n",
      "preceptor will now rather be his partner than his master, he should\r\n",
      "rather share the labour than attempt to direct it: this species of\r\n",
      "sympathy in study, diminishes the pain of attention, and gives an\r\n",
      "agreeable interest even in the most tiresome researches. When a young\r\n",
      "man perceives that his preceptor becomes in this manner the companion\r\n",
      "of his exertions, he loses all suspicion that he is compelled to\r\n",
      "mental labour; it is improper to say _loses_, for in a good education\r\n",
      "this suspicion need not ever be created: he discovers, we should\r\n",
      "rather say, that all the habits of attention which he has acquired,\r\n",
      "are those which are useful to men as well as to children, and he feels\r\n",
      "the advantage of his cultivated powers on every fresh occasion. He\r\n",
      "will perceive, that young men who have been ill educated, cannot, by\r\n",
      "any motive, command their vigorous attention, and he will feel the\r\n",
      "cause of his own superiority, when he comes to any trial of skill with\r\n",
      "inattentive _men of genius_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the arguments which Bayle uses, to prove that fortune has a\r\n",
      "greater influence than prudence in the affairs of men, is founded upon\r\n",
      "the common observation, that men of the best abilities cannot\r\n",
      "frequently recollect, in urgent circumstances, what they have said or\r\n",
      "done; the things occur to them perhaps a moment after they are past.\r\n",
      "The fact seems to be, that they could not, in the proper moment,\r\n",
      "command their attention; but this we should attribute to the want of\r\n",
      "prudence in their early education. Thus, Bayle's argument does not, in\r\n",
      "this point of view, prove any thing in favour of fortune. Those who\r\n",
      "can best command their attention, in the greatest variety of\r\n",
      "circumstances, have the most useful abilities; without this command of\r\n",
      "mind, men of genius, as they are called, are helpless beings; with it,\r\n",
      "persons of inferior capacity become valuable. Addison trembled and\r\n",
      "doubted, and doubted and trembled, when he was to write a common\r\n",
      "official paper; and it is said, that he was absolutely obliged to\r\n",
      "resign his place, because he could not decide in time whether he\r\n",
      "should write a _that_ or a _which_. No business could have been\r\n",
      "transacted by such an imbecile minister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To substitute voluntary for associated attention, we may withdraw some\r\n",
      "of the usually associated circumstances, and increase the excitement;\r\n",
      "and we may afterwards accustom the pupil to act from the hope of\r\n",
      "distant pleasures. Unless children can be actuated by the view of\r\n",
      "future distant advantage, they cannot be capable of long continued\r\n",
      "application. We shall endeavour to explain how the value of distant\r\n",
      "pleasures can be increased, and made to act with sufficient force upon\r\n",
      "the mind, when we hereafter speak of judgment and of imagination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It has been observed, that persons of wit and judgment have perhaps\r\n",
      "originally the same powers, and that the difference in their\r\n",
      "characters arises from their habits of attention, and the different\r\n",
      "class of objects to which they have turned their thoughts. The manner\r\n",
      "in which we are first taught to observe, and to reason, must in the\r\n",
      "first years of life decide these habits. There are two methods of\r\n",
      "teaching; one which ascends from particular facts to general\r\n",
      "principles, the other which descends from the general principles to\r\n",
      "particular facts; one which builds up, another which takes to pieces;\r\n",
      "the synthetic and the analytic method. The words analysis and\r\n",
      "synthesis are frequently misapplied, and it is difficult to write or\r\n",
      "to speak long about these methods without confounding them: in\r\n",
      "learning or in teaching, we often use them alternately. We first\r\n",
      "observe particulars; then form some general idea of classification;\r\n",
      "then descend again to new particulars, to observe whether they\r\n",
      "correspond with our principle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Children acquire knowledge, and their attention alternates from\r\n",
      "particular to general ideas, exactly in the same manner. It has been\r\n",
      "remarked, that men who have begun by forming suppositions, are\r\n",
      "inclined to adapt and to compress their consequent observations to\r\n",
      "the measure of their theories; they have been negligent in collecting\r\n",
      "facts, and have not condescended to try experiments. This disposition\r\n",
      "of mind, during a long period of time, retarded improvement, and\r\n",
      "knowledge was confined to a few peremptory maxims and exclusive\r\n",
      "principles. The necessity of collecting facts, and of trying\r\n",
      "experiments, was at length perceived; and in all the sciences this\r\n",
      "mode has lately prevailed: consequently, we have now on many subjects\r\n",
      "a treasure of accumulated facts. We are, in educating children, to put\r\n",
      "them in possession of all this knowledge; and a judicious preceptor\r\n",
      "will wish to know, not only how these facts can be crammed speedily\r\n",
      "into his pupil's memory, but what order of presenting them will be\r\n",
      "most advantageous to the understanding; he will desire to cultivate\r\n",
      "his pupil's faculties, that he may acquire new facts, and make new\r\n",
      "observations after all the old facts have been arranged in his mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By a judicious arrangement of past experiments, and by the rejection\r\n",
      "of what are useless, an able instructer can show, in a small compass,\r\n",
      "what it has cost the labour of ages to accumulate; he may teach in a\r\n",
      "few hours what the most ingenious pupil, left to his own random\r\n",
      "efforts, could not have learned in many years. It would take up as\r\n",
      "much time to go over all the steps which have been made in any\r\n",
      "science, as it originally cost the first discoverers. Simply to repeat\r\n",
      "all the fruitless experiments which have been made in chemistry, for\r\n",
      "instance, would probably employ the longest life that ever was devoted\r\n",
      "to science; nor would the individual have got one step forwarder; he\r\n",
      "would die, and with him his recapitulated knowledge; neither he nor\r\n",
      "the world would be the better for it. It is our business to save\r\n",
      "children all this useless labour, and all this waste of the power of\r\n",
      "attention. A pupil, who is properly instructed, with the same quantity\r\n",
      "of attention, learns, perhaps, a hundred times as much in the same\r\n",
      "time, as he could acquire under the tuition of a learned preceptor\r\n",
      "ignorant in the art of teaching.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The analytic and synthetic methods of instruction will both be found\r\n",
      "useful when judiciously employed. Where the enumeration of particulars\r\n",
      "fatigues the attention, we should, in teaching any science, begin by\r\n",
      "stating the general principles, and afterwards produce only the facts\r\n",
      "essential to their illustration and proof. But wherever we have not\r\n",
      "accumulated a sufficient number of facts to be accurately certain of\r\n",
      "any general principle, we must, however tedious the task, enumerate\r\n",
      "all the facts that are known, and warn the pupil of the imperfect\r\n",
      "state of the science. All the facts must, in this case, be stored up\r\n",
      "with scrupulous accuracy; we cannot determine which are unimportant,\r\n",
      "and which may prove essentially useful: this can be decided only by\r\n",
      "future experiments. By thus stating honestly to our pupils the extent\r\n",
      "of our ignorance, as well as the extent of our knowledge; by thus\r\n",
      "directing attention to the imperfections of science, rather than to\r\n",
      "the study of theories, we shall avoid the just reproaches which have\r\n",
      "been thrown upon the dogmatic vanity of learned preceptors.\r\n",

      "a family. They should not, in any degree, be permitted to interfere\r\n",

      "play-fellow, cannot suddenly command from him that species of\r\n",
      "deference, which is compounded of habitual respect for the person, and\r\n",
      "conventional submission to his station; the young master must,\r\n",
      "therefore, effect a change in his footman's manner of thinking and\r\n",
      "speaking by violent means; he must extort that tribute of respect\r\n",
      "which he has neglected so long, and to which, consequently, his right\r\n",
      "is disputed.[35] He is sensible, that his superiority is merely that\r\n",
      "of situation, and he, therefore, exerts his dormant prerogatives with\r\n",
      "jealous insolence. No master is so likely to become the tyrant of his\r\n",
      "valet-de-chambre, as he who is conscious that he never _can_ appear to\r\n",
      "him a hero. No servant feels the yoke of servitude more galling, than\r\n",

      "and they by no means think, that letting children pass several hours\r\n",
      "every day with servants, has any thing to do with the idea of living\r\n",
      "with them. We must contract this latitude of expression. If children\r\n",

      "four or five years old, they cannot dress or undress themselves, or,\r\n",
      "if they attempt it, they may learn careless habits, which in girls are\r\n",

      "a rule to be present when they are dressing, a maid-servant would not\r\n",
      "talk to them, and could do them but little injury. It is of\r\n",
      "consequence, that the maid-servant should herself be perfectly neat\r\n",
      "both from habit and taste. Children observe exactly the manner in\r\n",
      "which every thing is done for them, and have the wish, even before\r\n",
      "they have the power, to imitate what they see; they love order, if\r\n",
      "they are accustomed to it, and if their first attempts at arrangement\r\n",
      "are not made irksome by injudicious management. What they see done\r\n",
      "every day in a particular manner, they learn to think part of the\r\n",
      "business of the day, and they are uneasy if any of the rites of\r\n",
      "cleanliness are forgotten; the transition from this uneasiness, to the\r\n",
      "desire of exerting themselves, is soon made, particularly if they are\r\n",
      "sometimes left to feel the inconveniences of being helpless. This\r\n",
      "should, and can, be done, without affectation. A maid cannot be always\r\n",
      "ready, the instant she is wanted, to attend upon them; they should not\r\n",
      "be waited upon as being masters and misses, they should be assisted as\r\n",
      "being helpless.[37] They will not feel their vanity flattered by this\r\n",
      "attendance; the maid will not be suffered to amuse them, they will be\r\n",
      "ambitious of independence, and they will soon be proud of doing every\r\n",
      "thing for themselves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another circumstance which keeps children long in subjection to\r\n",
      "servants, is their not being able to wield a knife, fork, or spoon,\r\n",
      "with decent dexterity. Such habits are taught to them by the careless\r\n",
      "maids who feed them, that they cannot for many years be produced even\r\n",
      "at the side-table without much inconvenience and constant anxiety. If\r\n",
      "this anxiety in a mother were to begin a little sooner, it need never\r\n",
      "be intense; patient care in feeding children neatly at first, will\r\n",
      "save many a bitter reprimand afterwards; their little mouths and hands\r\n",
      "need not be disgusting at their meals, and their nurses had better\r\n",
      "take care not to let them touch what is disagreeable, instead of\r\n",
      "rubbing their lips rudely with a rough napkin, by way of making them\r\n",
      "love to have their mouths clean. These minutiæ must, in spite of\r\n",
      "didactic dignity, be noticed, because they lead to things of greater\r\n",
      "consequence; they are well worth the attention of a prudent mother or\r\n",
      "governess. If children are early taught to eat with care, they will\r\n",
      "not, from false shame, desire to dine[38] with the vulgar indulgent\r\n",
      "nursery-maid, rather than with the fastidious company at their\r\n",
      "mother's table. Children should first be taught to eat with a spoon\r\n",
      "what has been neatly cut for them; afterwards they should cut a little\r\n",
      "meat for themselves towards the end of dinner, when the rage of hunger\r\n",
      "is appeased; they will then have \"leisure to be good.\" The several\r\n",
      "operations of learning to eat with a spoon, to cut and to eat with a\r\n",
      "knife and fork, will become easy and habitual, if sufficient time be\r\n",
      "allowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Several children in a family, who were early attended to in all these\r\n",
      "little particulars, were produced at table when they were four or five\r\n",
      "years old; they suffered no constraint, nor were they ever banished to\r\n",
      "the nursery lest _company_ should detect their evil habits. Their eyes\r\n",
      "and ears were at liberty during the time of dinner; and instead of\r\n",
      "being absorbed in the contemplation of their plates, and at war with\r\n",
      "themselves and their neighbours, they could listen to conversation,\r\n",
      "and were amused even whilst they were eating. Without meaning to\r\n",
      "assert, with Rousseau, that all children are naturally gluttons or\r\n",
      "epicures, we must observe, that eating is their first great and\r\n",
      "natural pleasure; this pleasure should, therefore, be _entirely_ at\r\n",
      "the disposal of those who have the care of their education; it should\r\n",
      "be associated with the idea of their tutors or governesses. A\r\n",
      "governess may, perhaps, disdain to use the same means to make herself\r\n",
      "beloved by a child, as those which are employed by a nursery-maid; nor\r\n",
      "is it meant that children should be governed by their love of eating.\r\n",
      "Eating need not be made a reward, nor should we restrain their\r\n",
      "appetite as a punishment; praise and blame, and a variety of other\r\n",
      "excitements, must be preferred when we want to act upon their\r\n",
      "understanding. Upon this subject we shall speak more fully hereafter.\r\n",
      "All that is here meant to be pointed out, is, that the mere physical\r\n",
      "pleasure of eating should not be associated in the minds of children\r\n",
      "with servants; it should not be at the disposal of servants, because\r\n",
      "they may, in some degree, balance by this pleasure the other motives\r\n",
      "which a tutor may wish to put in action. \"Solid pudding,\" as well as\r\n",
      "\"empty praise,\" should be in the gift of the preceptor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Besides the pleasures of the table, there are many others which\r\n",
      "usually are associated early with servants. After children have been\r\n",
      "pent in a close formal drawing-room, motionless and mute, they are\r\n",
      "frequently dismissed to an apartment where there is no furniture too\r\n",
      "fine to be touched with impunity, where there is ample space, where\r\n",
      "they may jump and sing, and make as much noise as can be borne by the\r\n",
      "much-enduring eardrum of the nursery-maid. Children think this\r\n",
      "insensibility of ear a most valuable qualification in any person; they\r\n",
      "have no sympathy with more refined auditory nerves, and they prefer\r\n",
      "the company of those who are to them the best hearers. A medium\r\n",
      "between their taste and that of their parents should, in this\r\n",
      "instance, be struck; parents should not insist upon eternal silence,\r\n",
      "and children should not be suffered to make mere noise essential to\r\n",
      "their entertainment. Children should be encouraged to talk at proper\r\n",
      "times, and should have occupations provided for them when they are\r\n",
      "required to be still; by these means it will not be a restraint to\r\n",
      "them to stay in the same room with the rest of the family for some\r\n",
      "hours in the day. At other times they should have free leave to run\r\n",
      "about either in rooms where they cannot disturb others, or out of\r\n",
      "doors; in neither case should they be with servants. Children should\r\n",
      "never be sent out to walk with servants.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After they have been poring over their lessons, or stiffening under\r\n",

      "to the ready footman; they cluster round him for their hats, their\r\n",
      "gloves, their little boots and whips, and all the well known signals\r\n",
      "of pleasure. The hall door bursts open, and they sally forth under the\r\n",
      "interregnum of this beloved protector, to enjoy life and liberty; all\r\n",
      "the natural, and all the factitious ideas of the love of liberty, are\r\n",
      "connected with this distinct part of the day; the fresh air--the green\r\n",
      "fields--the busy streets--the gay shops--the variety of objects which\r\n",
      "the children see and hear--the freedom of their tongues--the joys of\r\n",
      "bodily exercise, and of mental relaxation, all conspire to make them\r\n",
      "prefer this period of the day, which they spend with the footman, to\r\n",
      "any other in the four-and-twenty hours. The footman sees, and is\r\n",
      "flattered by this; he is therefore assiduous to please, and piques\r\n",
      "himself upon being more indulgent than the hated preceptor. Servants\r\n",
      "usually wish to make themselves beloved by children; can it be\r\n",
      "wondered at if they succeed, when we consider the power that is thrown\r\n",
      "into their hands?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In towns, children have no gardens, no place where they can take that\r\n",
      "degree of exercise which is necessary for their health; this tempts\r\n",
      "their parents to trust them to servants, when they cannot walk with\r\n",
      "them themselves: but is there no individual in the family, neither\r\n",
      "tutor, nor governess, nor friend, nor brother, nor sister, who can\r\n",
      "undertake this daily charge? Cannot parents sacrifice some of their\r\n",
      "amusements in town, or cannot they live in the country? If none of\r\n",
      "these things can be done, without hesitation they should prefer a\r\n",
      "public to a private education. In these circumstances, they cannot\r\n",

      "them; they can have gardens, and safe places for exercise allotted to\r\n",
      "them. In rainy weather they can have rooms apart from the rest of the\r\n",

      "have access to them, and cannot, on any pretence of business, get the\r\n",
      "habit of frequenting them. Some fixed employment should be provided\r\n",

      "to relieve the Rhodians; and one of the merchants got into port sooner\r\n",
      "than the others; and he took advantage of this circumstance to sell\r\n",
      "his goods at an exorbitant rate, finding himself in possession of the\r\n",
      "market. The Rhodians did not know that the other ships laden with\r\n",
      "provisions were to be in the next day; and they, of course, paid this\r\n",

      "_sheeps_; and this mistake threw every thing into confusion. Besides\r\n",
      "this, a number of terms were made use of which were quite new to the\r\n",
      "boy. Getting into port--being in possession of the market--selling\r\n",
      "goods at an exorbitant rate; together with the whole mystery of buying\r\n",
      "and selling, were as new to him, and appeared to him as difficult to\r\n",
      "be understood, as the most abstract metaphysics. He did not even know\r\n",
      "what was meant by the ships being expected _in_ the next day; and\r\n",
      "\"_acting the part_ of an honest man,\" was to him an unusual mode of\r\n",

      "danger of the interference of friends and acquaintance in the\r\n",
      "education of their children, will yet, from the fear of offending,\r\n",
      "from the dread of being thought singular, submit to the evil. These\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It will be found impossible to educate a child at home, unless all\r\n",
      "interference from visiters and acquaintance is precluded. But it is of\r\n",
      "yet more consequence, that the members of the family must entirely\r\n",
      "agree in their sentiments, or at least in the conduct of the children\r\n",
      "under their care. Without this there is no hope. Young people perceive\r\n",
      "very quickly, whether there is unanimity in their government; they\r\n",
      "make out an alphabet of looks with unerring precision, and decipher\r\n",
      "with amazing ingenuity, all that is for their interest to understand.\r\n",
      "When children are blamed or punished, they always know pretty well who\r\n",
      "pities them, who thinks that they are in the wrong, and who thinks\r\n",
      "that they are in the right; and thus the influence of public opinion\r\n",
      "is what ultimately governs. If children find that, when mamma is\r\n",

      "readily under this partial disgrace, and they will suspect others of\r\n",
      "caprice, instead of ever blaming themselves. They will feel little\r\n",
      "confidence in their own experience, or in the assertions of others;\r\n",

      "ON TEMPER.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We have already, in speaking of the early care of infants, suggested\r\n",
      "that the temper should be attended to from the moment of their birth.\r\n",
      "A negligent, a careless, a passionate servant, must necessarily injure\r\n",
      "the temper of a child. The first language of an infant is\r\n",
      "intelligible only to its nurse; she can distinguish between the cry of\r\n",
      "pain and the note of ill humour, or the roar of passion. The cry of\r\n",
      "pain should be listened to with the utmost care, and every possible\r\n",
      "means should be used to relieve the child's sufferings; but when it is\r\n",
      "obvious that he cries from ill humour, a nurse should not sooth him\r\n",
      "with looks of affection, these she should reserve for the moment when\r\n",
      "the storm is over. We do not mean that infants should be suffered to\r\n",
      "cry for a length of time without being regarded; this would give them\r\n",
      "habits of ill humour: we only wish that the nurse would, as soon as\r\n",
      "possible, teach the child that what he wants can be obtained without\r\n",
      "his putting himself in a passion. Great care should be taken to\r\n",
      "prevent occasions for ill humour; if a nurse neglects her charge, or\r\n",
      "if she be herself passionate, the child will suffer so much pain, and\r\n",
      "so many disappointments, that it must be in a continual state of\r\n",
      "fretfulness. An active, cheerful, good humoured, intelligent nurse,\r\n",
      "will make a child good humoured by a regular, affectionate attendance;\r\n",
      "by endeavouring to prevent all unnecessary sufferings, and by quickly\r\n",
      "comprehending its language of signs. The best humoured woman in the\r\n",
      "world, if she is stupid, is not fit to have the care of a child; the\r\n",
      "child will not be able to make her understand any thing less than\r\n",
      "vociferation. By way of amusing the infant, she will fatigue it with\r\n",
      "her caresses; without ever discovering the real cause of his wo, she\r\n",
      "will sing one universal lullaby upon all occasions to pacify her\r\n",
      "charge.\r\n",

      "It requires some ingenuity to discover the cause and cure of those\r\n",
      "long and loud fits of crying, which frequently arise from imaginary\r\n",
      "apprehensions. A little boy of two years old, used to cry violently\r\n",
      "when he awoke in the middle of the night, and saw a candle in the\r\n",
      "room. It was observed that the shadow of the person who was moving\r\n",
      "about in the room frightened him, and as soon as the cause of his\r\n",
      "crying was found out, it was easy to pacify him; his fear of shadows\r\n",
      "was effectually cured, by playfully showing him, at different times,\r\n",
      "that shadows had no power to hurt him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "H----, about nine months old, when she first began to observe the\r\n",
      "hardness of bodies, let her hand fall upon a cat which had crept\r\n",
      "unperceived upon the table; she was surprised and terrified by the\r\n",
      "unexpected sensation of softness; she could not touch the cat, or any\r\n",
      "thing that felt like soft fur, without showing agitation, till she was\r\n",
      "near four years old, though every gentle means were used to conquer\r\n",

      "pictures, a small sized portrait, which was not amongst the number of\r\n",
      "those that had frightened him, was produced in broad day light. A\r\n",
      "piece of cake was put upon this picture, which the boy was desired to\r\n",
      "take; he took it, touched the picture, and was shown the canvas at the\r\n",
      "back of it, which, as it happened to be torn, he could easily identify\r\n",
      "with the painting: the picture was then given to him for a plaything;\r\n",
      "he made use of it as a table, and became very fond of it as soon as he\r\n",

      "penetration to distinguish between involuntary tears, and tears of\r\n",
      "caprice; but even when children are really cross, it is not, whilst\r\n",
      "they are very young, prudent to let them wear out their ill-humour, as\r\n",
      "some people do, in total neglect. Children, when they are left to weep\r\n",

      "endeavoured to explain the methods of managing[42] the attention of\r\n",
      "children with the least possible degree of pain. Yesterday a little\r\n",
      "boy of three years old, W----, was learning his alphabet from his\r\n",
      "father; after he had looked at one letter for some time with great\r\n",
      "attention, he raised his eyes, and with a look of much good humour,\r\n",
      "said to his father, \"It makes me tired to stand.\" His father seated\r\n",
      "him upon his knee, and told him that he did wisely in telling what\r\n",
      "tired him: the child, the moment he was seated, fixed his attentive\r\n",
      "eyes again upon his letters with fresh eagerness, and succeeded.\r\n",
      "Surely it was not humouring this boy to let him sit down when he was\r\n",
      "tired. If we teach a child that our assistance is to be purchased by\r\n",
      "fretful entreaties; if we show him, that we are afraid of a storm, he\r\n",
      "will make use of our apprehensions to accomplish his purposes. On the\r\n",
      "contrary, if he perceives that we can steadily resist his tears and\r\n",
      "ill humour, and especially if we show indifference upon the occasion,\r\n",
      "he will perceive that he had better dry his tears, suspend his rage,\r\n",
      "and try how far good humour will prevail. Children, who in every\r\n",
      "little difficulty are assisted by others, really believe that others\r\n",
      "are in fault whenever this assistance is not immediately offered. Look\r\n",
      "at a humoured child, for instance, trying to push a chair along the\r\n",
      "carpet; if a wrinkle in the carpet stops his progress, he either beats\r\n",
      "the chair, or instantly turns with an angry appealing look to his\r\n",
      "mother for assistance; and if she does not get up to help him, he will\r\n",
      "cry. Another boy, who has not been humoured, will neither beat the\r\n",
      "chair, nor angrily look round for help; but he will look immediately\r\n",
      "to see what it is that stops the chair, and when he sees the wrinkle\r\n",
      "in the carpet, he will either level or surmount the obstacle: during\r\n",
      "this whole operation, he will not feel in the least inclined to cry.\r\n",
      "Both these children might have had precisely the same original stock\r\n",
      "of patience; but by different management, the one would become\r\n",
      "passionate and peevish, the other both good humoured and persevering.\r\n",
      "The pleasure of success pays children, as well as men, for long toil\r\n",
      "and labour. Success is the proper reward of perseverance; but if we\r\n",
      "sometimes capriciously grant, and sometimes refuse, our help, our\r\n",
      "pupils cannot learn this important truth, and they imagine that\r\n",
      "success depends upon the will of others, and not upon their own\r\n",
      "efforts. A child, educated by a fairy, who sometimes came with magic\r\n",
      "aid to perform, and who was sometimes deaf to her call, would\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "ON OBEDIENCE.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Obedience has been often called the virtue of childhood. How far it is\r\n",
      "entitled to the name of virtue, we need not at present stop to\r\n",
      "examine. Obedience is expected from children long before they can\r\n",
      "reason upon the justice of our commands; consequently it must be\r\n",
      "taught as a habit. By associating pleasure with those things which we\r\n",
      "first desire children to do, we should make them necessarily like to\r\n",
      "obey; on the contrary, if we begin by ordering them to do what is\r\n",
      "difficult and disagreeable to them, they must dislike obedience. The\r\n",
      "poet seems to understand this subject when he says,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \"Or bid her wear your necklace rowed with pearl,\r\n",
      "    You'll find your Fanny an obedient girl.\"[45]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The taste for a necklace rowed with pearl, is not the _first_ taste,\r\n",
      "even in girls, that we should wish to cultivate; but the poet's\r\n",
      "_principle_ is good, notwithstanding. Bid your child do things that\r\n",
      "are agreeable to him, and you may be sure of his obedience. Bid a\r\n",
      "hungry boy eat apple pye; order a shivering urchin to warm himself at\r\n",
      "a good fire; desire him to go to bed when you see him yawn with\r\n",
      "fatigue, and by such seasonable commands you will soon form\r\n",
      "associations of pleasure in his mind, with the voice and tone of\r\n",
      "authority. This tone should never be threatening, or alarming; it\r\n",
      "should be gentle, but decided. Whenever it becomes necessary that a\r\n",
      "child should do what he feels disagreeable, it is better to make him\r\n",
      "submit at once to necessity, than to create any doubt and struggle in\r\n",
      "his mind, by leaving him a possibility of resistance. Suppose a\r\n",
      "little boy wishes to sit up later than the hour at which you think\r\n",
      "proper that he should go to bed; it is most prudent to take him to bed\r\n",
      "at the appointed time, without saying one word to him, either in the\r\n",
      "way of entreaty or command. If you entreat, you give the child an idea\r\n",
      "that he has it in his power to refuse you: if you command, and he does\r\n",
      "not instantly obey, you hazard your authority, and you teach him that\r\n",
      "he can successfully set his will in opposition to yours. The boy\r\n",
      "wishes to sit up; he sees no reason, in the moral fitness of things,\r\n",
      "why he should go to bed at one hour more than at another; all he\r\n",
      "perceives is, that such is your will. What does he gain by obeying\r\n",
      "you? Nothing: he loses the pleasure of sitting up half an hour longer.\r\n",
      "How can you then expect that he should, in consequence of these\r\n",
      "reasonings, give up his obvious immediate interest, and march off to\r\n",
      "bed heroically at the word of command? Let him not be put to the\r\n",
      "trial; when he has for some time been regularly taken to bed at a\r\n",
      "fixed hour, he will acquire the habit of thinking that he must go at\r\n",
      "that hour: association will make him expect it; and if his experience\r\n",
      "has been uniform, he will, without knowing why, think it necessary\r\n",
      "that he should do as he has been used to do. When the habit of\r\n",
      "obedience to customary necessity is thus formed, we may, without much\r\n",
      "risk, engraft upon it obedience to the voice of authority. For\r\n",
      "instance, when the boy hears the clock strike, the usual signal for\r\n",
      "his departure, you may, if you see that he is habitually ready to obey\r\n",
      "this signal, associate your commands with that to which he has already\r\n",
      "learned to pay attention. \"Go; it is time that you should go to bed\r\n",
      "now,\" will only seem to the child a confirmation of the sentence\r\n",
      "already pronounced by the clock: by degrees, your commands, after they\r\n",
      "have been regularly repeated, when the child feels no hope of evading\r\n",
      "them, will, even in new circumstances, have from association the power\r\n",
      "of compelling obedience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whenever we desire a child to do any thing, we should be perfectly\r\n",
      "certain, not only that it is a thing which he is capable of doing, but\r\n",
      "also, that it is something we can, in case it comes to that ultimate\r\n",
      "argument, force him to do. You cannot oblige a child to stand up, if\r\n",
      "he has a mind to sit down; or to walk, if he does not choose to exert\r\n",
      "his muscles for that purpose: but you can absolutely prevent him from\r\n",
      "touching whatever you desire him not to meddle with, by your superior\r\n",
      "strength. It is best, then, to begin with prohibitions; with such\r\n",
      "prohibitions as you can, and will, steadily persevere to enforce: if\r\n",
      "you are not exact in requiring obedience, you will never obtain it\r\n",
      "either by persuasion or authority. As it will require a considerable\r\n",
      "portion of time and unremitting attention, to enforce the punctual\r\n",
      "observance of a variety of prohibitions, it will, for your own sake,\r\n",
      "be most prudent to issue as few edicts as possible, and to be sparing\r\n",
      "in the use of the imperative mood. It will, if you calculate the\r\n",
      "trouble you must take day after day to watch your pupil, cost you less\r\n",
      "to begin by arranging every circumstance in your power, so as to\r\n",
      "prevent the necessity of trusting to laws what ought to be guarded\r\n",
      "against by precaution. Do you, for instance, wish to prevent your son\r\n",
      "from breaking a beautiful china jar in your drawing room; instead of\r\n",
      "forbidding him to touch it, put it out of his reach.--Would you\r\n",
      "prevent your son from talking to servants; let your house, in the\r\n",
      "first place, be so arranged, that he shall never be obliged to pass\r\n",
      "through any rooms where he is likely to meet with servants; let all\r\n",
      "his wants be gratified without their interference; let him be able to\r\n",
      "get at his hat without asking the footman to reach it for him, from\r\n",
      "its inaccessible height.[46] The simple expedient of hanging the hat\r\n",
      "in a place where the boy can reach it, will save you the trouble of\r\n",
      "continually repeating, \"Don't ask William, child, to reach your hat;\r\n",
      "can't you come and ask me?\" Yes, the boy can come and ask you; but if\r\n",
      "you are busy, you will not like to go in quest of the hat; your\r\n",
      "reluctance will possibly appear in your countenance, and the child,\r\n",
      "who understands the language of looks better than that of words, will\r\n",
      "clearly comprehend, that you are displeased with him at the very\r\n",
      "instant that he is fulfilling the letter of the law.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A lady, who was fond of having her house well arranged, discovered, to\r\n",
      "the amazement of her acquaintance, the art of making all her servants\r\n",
      "keep every thing in its place. Even in the kitchen, from the most\r\n",
      "minute article to the most unwieldy, every thing was invariably to be\r\n",
      "found in its allotted station; the servants were thought miracles of\r\n",
      "obedience; but, in fact, they obeyed because it was the easiest thing\r\n",
      "they could possibly do. Order was made more convenient to them than\r\n",
      "disorder, and, with their utmost ingenuity to save themselves trouble,\r\n",
      "they could not invent places for every thing more appropriate than\r\n",
      "those which had been assigned by their mistress's legislative economy.\r\n",
      "In the same manner we may secure the _orderly_ obedience of children,\r\n",
      "without exhausting their patience or our own. Rousseau advises, that\r\n",
      "children should be governed solely by the necessity of circumstances;\r\n",
      "but there are _one and twenty_ excellent objections to this system;\r\n",
      "the first being, that it is impossible: of this Rousseau must have\r\n",
      "been sensible in the trials which he made as a preceptor. When he had\r\n",
      "the management of a refractory child, he found himself obliged to\r\n",
      "invent and arrange a whole drama, by artificial experience, to\r\n",
      "convince his little pupil, that he had better not walk out in the\r\n",
      "streets of Paris alone; and that, therefore, he should wait until his\r\n",
      "pupil could conveniently accompany him. Rousseau had prepared the\r\n",
      "neighbours on each side of the street to make proper speeches as his\r\n",
      "pupil passed by their doors, which alarmed and piqued the boy\r\n",
      "effectually. At length the child was met at a proper time, by a friend\r\n",
      "who had been appointed to watch him; and thus he was brought home\r\n",
      "submissive. This scene, as Rousseau observes, was admirably well\r\n",
      "performed;[47] but what occasion could there be for so much\r\n",
      "contrivance and deceit? If his pupil had not been uncommonly deficient\r\n",
      "in penetration, he would soon have discovered his preceptor in some of\r\n",
      "his artifices; then adieu both to obedience and confidence. A false\r\n",
      "idea of the pleasures of liberty misled Rousseau. Children have not\r\n",
      "our abstract ideas of the pleasures of liberty; they do not, until\r\n",
      "they have suffered from ill judged restraints, feel any strong desire\r\n",
      "to exercise what we call free will; liberty is, with them, the liberty\r\n",
      "of doing certain specific things which they have found to be\r\n",
      "agreeable; liberty is not the general idea of pleasure, in doing\r\n",
      "whatever they WILL _to do_. Rousseau desires, that _we should not let\r\n",
      "our pupil know, that in doing our will he is obedient to us_. But why?\r\n",
      "Why should we not let a child know the truth? If we attempt to conceal\r\n",
      "it, we shall only get into endless absurdities and difficulties. Lord\r\n",
      "Kames tells us, that he was acquainted with a couple, who, in the\r\n",
      "education of their family, pursued as much as possible Rousseau's\r\n",
      "plan. One evening, as the father was playing at chess with a friend,\r\n",
      "one of his children, a boy of about four years old, took a piece from\r\n",
      "the board, and ran away to play with it. The father, whose principles\r\n",
      "would not permit him to assert his right to his own chessman, began to\r\n",
      "bargain for his property with his son. \"Harry,\" said he, \"let us have\r\n",
      "back the man, and there's an apple for you.\" The apple was soon\r\n",
      "devoured, and the child returned to the chess board, and kidnapped\r\n",
      "another chessman. What this man's ransom might be, we are not yet\r\n",
      "informed; but Lord Kames tells us, that the father was obliged to\r\n",
      "suspend his game at chess until his son was led away to his supper.\r\n",
      "Does it seem just, that parents should become slaves to the liberties\r\n",
      "of their children? If one set of beings or another should sacrifice a\r\n",
      "portion of happiness, surely those who are the most useful, and the\r\n",
      "most capable of increasing the knowledge and the pleasures of life,\r\n",
      "have some claim to a preference; and when the power is entirely in\r\n",
      "their own hands, it is most probable that they will defend their own\r\n",
      "interests. We shall not, like many who have spoken of Rousseau, steal\r\n",
      "from him after having abused him. His remarks upon the absurd and\r\n",
      "tyrannical restraints which are continually imposed upon children by\r\n",
      "the folly of nurses and servants, or by the imprudent anxiety of\r\n",
      "parents and preceptors, are excellent. Whenever Rousseau is in the\r\n",
      "right, his eloquence is irresistible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To determine what degree of obedience it is just to require from\r\n",
      "children, we must always consider what degree of reason they possess:\r\n",
      "whenever we can use reason, we should never use force; it is only\r\n",
      "whilst children are too young to comprehend reason,[48] that we should\r\n",
      "expect from them implicit submission. The means which have been\r\n",
      "pointed out for teaching the habit of obedience, must not be depended\r\n",
      "upon for teaching any thing more than the mere habit. When children\r\n",
      "begin to reason, they do not act merely from habit; they will not be\r\n",
      "obedient at this age, unless their understanding is convinced that it\r\n",
      "is for their advantage to be so. Wherever we can explain the reasons\r\n",
      "for any of our requests, we should attempt it; but whenever these\r\n",
      "cannot be fully explained, it is better not to give a partial\r\n",
      "explanation; it will be best to say steadily, \"You cannot understand\r\n",
      "this now, you will, perhaps, understand it some time hence.\" Whenever\r\n",
      "we tell children, that we forbid them to do such and such things for\r\n",
      "any particular reason, we must take care that the reason assigned is\r\n",
      "adequate, and that it will in all cases hold good. For instance, if we\r\n",
      "forbid a boy to eat unripe fruit, _because it will make him ill_, and\r\n",
      "if afterwards the boy eat some unripe gooseberries without feeling ill\r\n",
      "in consequence of his disobedience, he will doubt the truth of the\r\n",
      "person who prohibited unripe fruit; he will rather trust his own\r\n",
      "partial experience than any assertions. The idea of _hurting his\r\n",
      "health_, is a general idea, which he does not yet comprehend. It is\r\n",
      "more prudent to keep him out of the way of unripe gooseberries, than\r\n",
      "to hazard at once his obedience and his integrity. We need not\r\n",
      "expatiate further; the instance we have given, may be readily applied\r\n",
      "to all cases in which children have it in their power to disobey with\r\n",
      "_immediate_ impunity, and, what is still more dangerous, with the\r\n",
      "certainty of obtaining immediate pleasure. The gratification of their\r\n",
      "senses, and the desire of bodily exercise, ought never to be\r\n",
      "unnecessarily restrained. Our pupils should distinctly perceive, that\r\n",
      "we wish to make them happy, and every instance, in which they discover\r\n",
      "that obedience has really made them happier, will be more in our\r\n",
      "favour, than all the lectures we could preach. From the past, they\r\n",
      "will judge of the future. Children, who have for many years\r\n",
      "experienced, that their parents have exacted obedience only to such\r\n",
      "commands as proved to be ultimately wise and beneficial, will surely\r\n",
      "be disposed from habit, from gratitude, and yet more from prudence, to\r\n",
      "consult their parents in all the material actions of their lives.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We may observe, that the spirit of contradiction, which sometimes\r\n",

      "Of all the faults to which children are subject, there is none which\r\n",

      "it is early observed by those who are engaged in education, it is\r\n",
      "sometimes supposed to be inherent in the temper; but, so far from\r\n",
      "being naturally obstinate, infants show those strong propensities to\r\n",
      "sympathy and imitation, which prepare them for an opposite character.\r\n",
      "The folly of the nurse, however, makes an intemperate use of these\r\n",
      "happy propensities. She perpetually torments the child to exert\r\n",
      "himself for her amusement; all his senses and all his muscles she\r\n",
      "commands. He must see, hear, talk, or be silent, move or be still,\r\n",
      "when she thinks proper; and often with the desire of amusing her\r\n",
      "charge, or of showing him off to the company, she disgusts him with\r\n",
      "voluntary exertion. Before young children have completely acquired the\r\n",
      "use of their limbs, they cannot perform feats of activity or of\r\n",
      "dexterity at a moment's warning. Their muscles do not instantaneously\r\n",
      "obey their will; the efforts they make are painful to themselves; the\r\n",
      "awkwardness of their attempts is painful to others; the delay of the\r\n",
      "body is often mistaken for the reluctance of the mind; and the\r\n",
      "impatient tutor pronounces the child to be obstinate, whilst all the\r\n",
      "time he may be doing his utmost to obey. Instead of growing angry with\r\n",
      "the helpless child, it would be surely more wise to assist his feeble\r\n",

      "meaning of the word jump. The father, instead of pressing him further,\r\n",
      "asked several other children who happened to be in the room to jump,\r\n",
      "and he jumped along with them: all this was done playfully. The little\r\n",
      "boy looked on silently for a short time, and seemed much pleased.\r\n",
      "\"Papa jumps!\" he exclaimed. His brother L---- lifted him up two or\r\n",
      "three times; and he then tried to jump, and succeeded: from sympathy\r\n",
      "he learned the command of the muscles which were necessary to his\r\n",
      "jumping, and to his obedience. If this boy had been importuned, or\r\n",
      "forced to exert himself, he might have been thus taught obstinacy,\r\n",
      "merely from the imprudent impatience of the spectators. The reluctance\r\n",
      "to stop when a child is once in motion, is often mistaken for\r\n",
      "obstinacy: when he is running, singing, laughing, or talking, if you\r\n",
      "suddenly command him to stop, he cannot instantly obey you. If we\r\n",
      "reflect upon our own minds, we may perceive that we cannot, without\r\n",

      "which we have been long intent. If we have been long in a carriage,\r\n",
      "the noise of the wheels sounds in our ear, and we seem to be yet going\r\n",
      "on after the carriage has stopped. We do not pretend to found any\r\n",
      "accurate reasoning upon analogy; but we may observe, the difficulty\r\n",

      "noise. W---- paused for a moment, but then went on singing the same\r\n",
      "words. His brother said, Hush! W---- paused for another second or two;\r\n",
      "but then went on with his roundelay. In his countenance there was not\r\n",
      "the slightest appearance of ill humour. One of his sisters put him\r\n",
      "upon a board which was lying on the floor, and which was a little\r\n",

      "those who govern them; it is better to stop them by presenting new\r\n",

      "voice. Children should never be accused of obstinacy; the accusation\r\n",
      "cannot cure, but may superinduce the disease. If, unfortunately, they\r\n",
      "have been suffered to contract a disposition to this fault, it may be\r\n",

      "feel the difference between the slight inconvenience to which they\r\n",
      "expose themselves by speaking the truth, and the great disgrace to\r\n",
      "which falsehood would subject them. The pleasure of being esteemed,\r\n",
      "and trusted, is early felt, and the consciousness of deserving\r\n",
      "confidence is delightful to children; but their young fortitude and\r\n",
      "courage should never be exposed to severe temptations. It is not\r\n",
      "sufficient to excite an admiration of truth by example, by eloquent\r\n",
      "praise, or by the just rewards of esteem and affection; we must take\r\n",
      "care to form the habits at the same time that we inspire the love of\r\n",

      "work by seeing any extraordinary difference made by judges of eating\r\n",
      "between one species of food and another. In families where a regularly\r\n",
      "good table is kept, children accustomed to the sight and taste of all\r\n",
      "kinds of food, are seldom delicate, capricious, or disposed to exceed;\r\n",
      "but in houses where entertainments are made from time to time with\r\n",
      "great bustle and anxiety, fine clothes, and company-manners, and\r\n",
      "company-faces, and all that politeness can do to give the appearance\r\n",
      "of festivity, deceive children at least, and make them imagine that\r\n",
      "there is some extraordinary joy in seeing a greater number of dishes\r\n",
      "than usual upon the table. Upon these occasions, indeed, the pleasure\r\n",
      "is to them substantial; they eat more, they eat a greater variety, and\r\n",
      "of things that please them better than usual; the pleasure of eating\r\n",
      "is associated with unusual cheerfulness, and thus the imagination, and\r\n",
      "the reality, conspire to make them epicures. To these children, the\r\n",
      "temptations to deceive about sweetmeats and dainties are beyond\r\n",
      "measure great, especially as ill-bred strangers commonly show their\r\n",
      "affection for them by pressing them to eat what they are not allowed\r\n",
      "to say \"_if you please_\" to. Rousseau thinks all children are\r\n",
      "gluttons. All children may be rendered gluttons; but few, who are\r\n",
      "properly treated with respect to food, and who have any literary\r\n",
      "tastes, can be in danger of continuing to be fond of eating. We\r\n",

      "broken with impunity, and thus the children learn habits of successful\r\n",
      "deceit. Instead of circumscribing their play grounds, as they are\r\n",
      "sometimes called, by narrow inconvenient limits, we should allow them\r\n",
      "as much space as we can with convenience, and at all events exact no\r\n",

      "precautions in issuing orders, but these precautions will be more\r\n",
      "useful in preserving the integrity of their pupils, than the most\r\n",

      "of wit and humour, by the austerity of his presence, a preceptor, with\r\n",

      "judge impartially of their own merits. If we are exact in the measure\r\n",
      "of approbation which we bestow, they will hence form a scale by which\r\n",

      "and this adroitness in breaking through fences, was termed \"getting\r\n",

      "all distinction of character amongst the native Africans, is soon lost\r\n",
      "under the levelling influence of slavery. Oppression and terror\r\n",
      "necessarily produce meanness and deceit in all climates, and in all\r\n",
      "ages; and wherever fear is the governing motive in education, we must\r\n",
      "expect to find in children a propensity to dissimulation, if not\r\n",
      "confirmed habits of falsehood. Look at the true born Briton under the\r\n",

      "stubborn falsehoods which you hear from the school-boy, can you\r\n",
      "discover any of that innate dignity of soul which is the boasted\r\n",
      "national characteristic? Look again; look at the same boy in the\r\n",
      "company of those who inspire no terror; in the company of his\r\n",
      "school-fellows, of his friends, of his parents; would you know him to\r\n",
      "be the same being? his countenance is open; his attitude erect; his\r\n",
      "voice firm; his language free and fluent; his thoughts are upon his\r\n",
      "lips; he speaks truth without effort, without fear. Where individuals\r\n",
      "are oppressed, or where they believe that they are oppressed, they\r\n",
      "combine against their oppressors, and oppose cunning and falsehood to\r\n",
      "power and force; they think themselves released from the compact of\r\n",
      "truth with their masters, and bind themselves in a strict league with\r\n",
      "each other; thus school-boys hold no faith with their schoolmaster,\r\n",
      "though they would think it shameful to be dishonourable amongst one\r\n",
      "another. We do not think that these maxims are the peculiar growth of\r\n",

      "tyrannical, their pupils will contrive to conceal from them their\r\n",
      "actions and their thoughts. On the contrary, in families where\r\n",
      "sincerity has been encouraged by the voice of praise and affection, a\r\n",
      "generous freedom of conversation and countenance appears, and the\r\n",
      "young people talk to each other, and to their parents, without\r\n",
      "distinction or reserve; without any distinction but such as superior\r\n",
      "esteem and respect dictate. These are feelings totally distinct from\r\n",

      "to acquire and to preserve character.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The value of a character for truth, should be distinctly felt by\r\n",
      "children in their own family: whilst they were very young, we advised\r\n",
      "that their integrity should not be tempted; as they grow up, trust\r\n",
      "should by degrees be put in them, and we should distinctly explain to\r\n",
      "them, that our confidence is to be deserved before it can be given.\r\n",
      "Our belief in any person's truth, is not a matter of affection, but of\r\n",
      "experience and necessity; we cannot doubt the assertions of any person\r\n",
      "whom we have found to speak uniformly the truth; we cannot believe any\r\n",
      "person, let us wish to do it ever so much, if we have detected him in\r\n",
      "falsehoods. Before we have had experience of a person's integrity, we\r\n",
      "may hope, or take it for granted, that he is perfectly sincere and\r\n",
      "honest; but we cannot feel more than _belief upon trust_, until we\r\n",

      "advantageous manner in which truth has always been represented to\r\n",
      "them, that they will act honourably; this hope is natural and just,\r\n",

      "a child, we should not say, \"I am sure you will not deceive me; I can\r\n",
      "trust you with any thing in the world.\" This is flattery or folly; it\r\n",
      "is paying beforehand, which is not the way to get business done; why\r\n",
      "cannot we, especially as we are teaching truth, say the thing that\r\n",
      "is--\"I _hope_ you will not deceive me. If I find that you may be\r\n",
      "trusted, you know I shall be able to trust you another time: this must\r\n",
      "depend upon you, not entirely upon me.\" We must make ourselves certain\r\n",
      "upon these occasions, how the child conducts himself; nor is it\r\n",
      "necessary to use any artifice, or to affect, from false delicacy, any\r\n",

      "too strongly impressed upon their minds, that this character must be\r\n",
      "preserved, as it was obtained, by their own conduct. If one link in\r\n",
      "the chain of confidence be broken, the whole is destroyed. Indeed,\r\n",
      "where habits of truth are early formed, we may safely depend upon\r\n",
      "them. A young person, who has never deceived, would see, that the\r\n",
      "first step in falsehood costs too much to be hazarded. Let this appear\r\n",
      "in the form of calculation, rather than of sentiment. To habit, to\r\n",
      "enthusiasm, we owe much of all our virtues--to reason more; and the\r\n",
      "more of them we owe to reason, the better. Habit and enthusiasm are\r\n",
      "subject to sudden or gradual changes--but reason continues for ever\r\n",
      "the same. As the understanding unfolds, we should fortify all our\r\n",
      "pupil's habits; and virtuous enthusiasm, by the conviction of their\r\n",
      "utility, of their being essential to the happiness of society in\r\n",
      "general, and conducive immediately to the happiness of every\r\n",
      "individual. Possessed of this conviction, and provided with\r\n",

      "arguments\" with more success, than when she assumes the air of\r\n",
      "raillery, and the tone of gayety. All vivacious young people are fond\r\n",
      "of wit; we do not mean children, for they do not understand it. Those\r\n",
      "who have the best capacities, and the strictest habits of veracity,\r\n",
      "often appear to common observers absolutely stupid, from their\r\n",
      "aversion to any play upon words, and from the literal simplicity with\r\n",
      "which they believe every thing that is asserted. A remarkably\r\n",
      "intelligent little girl of four years old, but who had never in her\r\n",
      "own family been used to the common phrases which sometimes pass for\r\n",
      "humour, happened to hear a gentleman say, as he looked out of the\r\n",
      "window one rainy morning, \"It rains cats and dogs to-day.\" The child,\r\n",
      "with a surprised, but believing look, immediately went to look out of\r\n",
      "the window to see the phenomenon. This extreme simplicity in\r\n",
      "childhood, is sometimes succeeded in youth by a strong taste for wit\r\n",
      "and humour. Young people are, in the first place, proud to show that\r\n",
      "they understand them; and they are gratified by the perception of a\r\n",
      "new intellectual pleasure. At this period of their education, great\r\n",

      "with ease and gayety of manners, and with a certain air of frank\r\n",
      "carelessness, which can scarcely fail to please. Gil Blas,[55] Tom\r\n",
      "Jones, Lovelace, Count Fathom, are all of this class of characters.\r\n",

      "approbation and pleasure in reading of these characters arise. In\r\n",
      "books, we do not actually suffer by the tricks of rogues, or by the\r\n",
      "lies they tell. Hence their truth is to us a quality of no value; but\r\n",
      "their wit, humour, and the ingenuity of their contrivances, are of\r\n",
      "great value to us, because they afford us entertainment. The most\r\n",

      "complete view of his ledger and day-book, together with the regular\r\n",
      "balancings of his accounts, would probably not afford quite so much\r\n",
      "entertainment, even to a reader of the most unblemished integrity and\r\n",
      "phlegmatic temper, as the adventures of Gil Blas, and Jonathan Wild,\r\n",
      "adorned with all the wit of Le Sage, and humour of Fielding. When Gil\r\n",
      "Blas lays open his whole heart to us, and tells us all his sins,\r\n",
      "unwhipt of justice, we give him credit for making us his confidant,\r\n",
      "and we forget that this sincerity, and these liberal confessions, are\r\n",
      "not characteristic of the hero's disposition, but essential only to\r\n",
      "the novel. The novel writer could not tell us all he had to say\r\n",
      "without this dying confession, and inconsistent openness, from his\r\n",
      "accomplished villain. The reader is ready enough to forgive, having\r\n",
      "never been duped. When young people can make all these reflections for\r\n",

      "of occupations, new objects, especially such as excite and employ the\r\n",
      "senses, will be found highly advantageous. Sudden pleasure, from\r\n",
      "strong expressions of affection, or eloquent praise, whenever the\r\n",
      "child speaks truth, will operate powerfully in breaking his habits of\r\n",
      "equivocation. We do not advise parents to try sudden pain with\r\n",
      "children at this early age, neither do we advise bodily correction, or\r\n",
      "lasting _penitences_, meant to excite shame, because these depress and\r\n",
      "enfeeble the mind, and a propensity to falsehood ultimately arises\r\n",

      "they have no opportunities of deceiving: the same command of mind and\r\n",
      "courage, proceeding from the consciousness of strength and fortitude,\r\n",

      "were certain that he could bear the pain, or do without the\r\n",

      "ON REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To avoid, in education, all unnecessary severity, and all dangerous\r\n",
      "indulgence, we must form just ideas of the nature and use of rewards\r\n",
      "and punishments. Let us begin with considering the nature of\r\n",
      "punishment, since it is best to get the most disagreeable part of our\r\n",
      "business done the first.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Several benevolent and enlightened authors[62] have endeavoured to\r\n",
      "explain the use of penal laws, and to correct the ideas which formerly\r\n",
      "prevailed concerning public justice. Punishment is no longer\r\n",
      "considered, except by the ignorant and sanguinary, as vengeance from\r\n",
      "the injured, or expiation from the guilty. We now distinctly\r\n",
      "understand, that the greatest possible happiness of the whole society\r\n",
      "must be the ultimate object of all just legislation; that the partial\r\n",
      "evil of punishment is consequently to be tolerated by the wise and\r\n",
      "humane legislator, only so far as it is proved to be necessary for the\r\n",
      "general good. When a crime has been committed, it cannot be undone by\r\n",
      "all the art, or all the power of man; by vengeance the most\r\n",
      "sanguinary, or remorse the most painful. The past is irrevocable; all\r\n",
      "that remains, is to provide for the future. It would be absurd, after\r\n",
      "an offence has already been committed, to increase the sum of misery\r\n",
      "in the world, by inflicting pain upon the offender, unless that pain\r\n",
      "were afterwards to be productive of happiness to society, either by\r\n",
      "preventing the criminal from repeating his offence, or by deterring\r\n",
      "others from similar enormities. With this double view of restraining\r\n",
      "individuals, by the recollection of past sufferings, from future\r\n",
      "crimes, and of teaching others, by public examples, to expect, and to\r\n",
      "fear, certain evils as the necessary consequences of certain actions\r\n",
      "hurtful to society, all wise laws are framed, and all just punishments\r\n",
      "are inflicted. It is only by the conviction that certain punishments\r\n",
      "are essential to the general security and happiness, that a person of\r\n",
      "humanity can, or ought, to fortify his mind against the natural\r\n",
      "feelings of compassion. These feelings are the most painful, and the\r\n",
      "most difficult to resist, when, as it sometimes unavoidably happens,\r\n",
      "public justice requires the total sacrifice of the happiness, liberty,\r\n",
      "or perhaps the life, of a fellow-creature, whose ignorance precluded\r\n",
      "him from virtue, and whose neglected or depraved education prepared\r\n",
      "him, by inevitable degrees, for vice and all its miseries. How\r\n",
      "exquisitely painful must be the feelings of a humane judge, in\r\n",
      "pronouncing sentence upon such a devoted being! But the law permits of\r\n",
      "no refined metaphysical disquisitions. It would be vain to plead the\r\n",
      "necessitarian's doctrine of an unavoidable connection between the past\r\n",
      "and the future, in all human actions; the same necessity compels the\r\n",
      "punishment that compels the crime; nor could, nor ought, the most\r\n",
      "eloquent advocate, in a court of justice, to obtain a criminal's\r\n",
      "acquittal by entering into a minute history of the errours of his\r\n",
      "education.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is the business of education to prevent crimes, and to prevent all\r\n",
      "those habitual propensities which necessarily lead to their\r\n",
      "commission. The legislator can consider only the large interests of\r\n",
      "society; the preceptor's view is fixed upon the individual interests\r\n",
      "of his pupil. Fortunately both must ultimately agree. To secure for\r\n",
      "his pupil the greatest possible quantity of happiness, taking in the\r\n",
      "whole of life, must be the wish of the preceptor: this includes every\r\n",
      "thing. We immediately perceive the connection between that happiness,\r\n",
      "and obedience to all the laws on which the prosperity of society\r\n",
      "depends.--We yet further perceive, that the probability of our pupil's\r\n",
      "yielding not only an implicit, but an habitual, rational, voluntary,\r\n",
      "happy obedience, to such laws, must arise from the connection which\r\n",
      "_he_ believes, and feels, that there exists between his social duties\r\n",
      "and his social happiness. How to induce this important belief, is the\r\n",
      "question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is obvious, that we cannot explain to the comprehension of a child\r\n",
      "of three or four years old, all the truths of morality; nor can we\r\n",
      "demonstrate to him the justice of punishments, by showing him that we\r\n",
      "give present pain to ensure future advantage. But, though we cannot\r\n",
      "demonstrate to the child that we are just, we may satisfy ourselves\r\n",
      "upon this subject, and we may conduct ourselves, during his non-age of\r\n",
      "understanding, with the scrupulous integrity of a guardian. Before we\r\n",
      "can govern by reason, we can, by associating pain or pleasure with\r\n",
      "certain actions, give habits, and these habits will be either\r\n",
      "beneficial or hurtful to the pupil: we must, if they be hurtful\r\n",
      "habits, conquer them by fresh punishments, and thus we make the\r\n",
      "helpless child suffer for our negligence and mistakes. Formerly in\r\n",
      "Scotland there existed a law, which obliged every farrier who, through\r\n",
      "ignorance or drunkenness, pricked a horse's foot in shoeing him, to\r\n",
      "deposit the price of the horse until he was sound, to furnish the\r\n",
      "owner with another, and in case the horse could not be cured, the\r\n",
      "farrier was doomed to indemnify the injured owner. At the same rate of\r\n",
      "punishment, what indemnification should be demanded from a careless or\r\n",
      "ignorant preceptor?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When a young child puts his finger too near the fire, he burns\r\n",
      "himself; the pain immediately follows the action; they are associated\r\n",
      "together in the child's memory; if he repeat the experiment often, and\r\n",
      "constantly with the same result, the association will be so strongly\r\n",
      "formed, that the child will ever afterwards expect these two things to\r\n",
      "happen together: whenever he puts his finger into fire, he will expect\r\n",
      "to feel pain; he will learn yet further, as these things regularly\r\n",
      "follow one another, to think one the cause, and the other the effect.\r\n",
      "He may not have words to express these ideas; nor can we explain how\r\n",
      "the belief that events, which have happened together, will again\r\n",
      "happen together, is by experience induced in the mind. This is a fact,\r\n",
      "which no metaphysicians pretend to dispute; but it has not yet, that\r\n",
      "we know of, been accounted for by any. It would be rash to assert,\r\n",
      "that it will not in future be explained, but at present we are totally\r\n",
      "in the dark upon the subject. It is sufficient for our purpose to\r\n",
      "observe, that this association of facts, or of ideas, affects the\r\n",
      "actions of all rational beings, and of many animals who are called\r\n",
      "irrational. Would you teach a dog or a horse to obey you; do you not\r\n",
      "associate pleasure, or pain, with the things you wish that they should\r\n",
      "practise, or avoid? The impatient and ignorant give infinitely more\r\n",
      "pain than is necessary to the animals they educate. If the pain, which\r\n",
      "we would associate with any action, do not _immediately_ follow it,\r\n",
      "the child does not understand us; if several events happen nearly at\r\n",
      "the same time, it is impossible that a child can at first distinguish\r\n",
      "which are causes, and which are effects. Suppose, that a mother would\r\n",
      "teach her little son, that he must not put his dirty shoes upon her\r\n",
      "clean sofa: if she frowns upon him, or speaks to him in an angry tone,\r\n",
      "at the instant that he sets his foot and shoe upon the sofa, he\r\n",
      "desists; but he has only learned, that putting a foot upon the sofa,\r\n",
      "and his mother's frown, follow each other; his mother's frown, from\r\n",
      "former associations, gives him perhaps, some pain, or the expectation\r\n",
      "of some pain, and consequently he avoids repeating the action which\r\n",
      "immediately preceded the frown. If, a short time afterwards, the\r\n",
      "little boy, forgetting the frown, accidentally gets upon the sofa\r\n",
      "_without his shoes_, no evil follows; but it is not probable, that he\r\n",
      "can, by this single experiment, discover that his shoes have made all\r\n",
      "the difference in the two cases. Children are frequently so much\r\n",
      "puzzled by their confused experience of impunity and punishment, that\r\n",
      "they are quite at a loss how to conduct themselves. Whenever our\r\n",
      "punishments are not made intelligible, they are cruel; they give pain,\r\n",
      "without producing any future advantage. To make punishment\r\n",
      "intelligible to children, it must be not only _immediately_, but\r\n",
      "_repeatedly_ and _uniformly_, associated with the actions which we\r\n",
      "wish them to avoid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When children begin to reason, punishment affects them in a different\r\n",
      "manner from what it did whilst they were governed, like irrational\r\n",
      "animals, merely by the direct associations of pleasure and pain. They\r\n",
      "distinguish, in many instances, between coincidence and causation;\r\n",
      "they discover, that the will of others is the immediate cause,\r\n",
      "frequently, of the pain they suffer; they learn by experience, that\r\n",
      "the _will_ is not an unchangeable cause, that it is influenced by\r\n",
      "circumstances, by passions, by persuasion, by caprice. It must be,\r\n",
      "however, by slow degrees, that they acquire any ideas of justice. They\r\n",
      "cannot know our views relative to their future happiness; their first\r\n",
      "ideas of the justice of the punishments we inflict, cannot, therefore,\r\n",
      "be accurate. They regulate these first judgments by the simple idea,\r\n",
      "that our punishments ought to be exactly the same always in the same\r\n",
      "circumstances; when they understand words, they learn to expect that\r\n",
      "our words and actions should precisely agree, that we should keep our\r\n",
      "promises, and _fulfil_ our threats. They next learn, that as they are\r\n",
      "punished for voluntary faults, they cannot justly be punished until it\r\n",
      "has been distinctly explained to them what is _wrong_ or _forbidden_,\r\n",
      "and what is _right_ or _permitted_. The words _right_ or _wrong_,\r\n",
      "and _permitted_ or _forbidden_, are synonymous at first in the\r\n",
      "apprehensions of children; and obedience and disobedience are their\r\n",
      "only ideas of virtue and vice. Whatever we command to be done, or\r\n",
      "rather whatever we associate with pleasure, they imagine to be right;\r\n",
      "whatever we prohibit, provided we have uniformly associated it with\r\n",
      "pain, they believe to be wrong. This implicit submission to our\r\n",
      "authority, and these confined ideas of right and wrong, are\r\n",
      "convenient, or apparently convenient, to indolent or tyrannical\r\n",
      "governours; and they sometimes endeavour to prolong the reign of\r\n",
      "ignorance, with the hope of establishing in the mind an opinion of\r\n",
      "their own infallibility. But this is a dangerous, as well as an\r\n",
      "unjust, system. By comparison with the conduct and opinions of others,\r\n",
      "children learn to judge of their parents and preceptors; by reading\r\n",
      "and by conversation, they acquire more enlarged notions of right and\r\n",
      "wrong; and their obedience, unless it then arise from the conviction\r\n",
      "of their understandings, depends but on a very precarious foundation.\r\n",
      "The mere association of pleasure and pain, in the form of reward and\r\n",
      "punishment, with any given action, will not govern them; they will now\r\n",
      "examine whether there is any moral or physical _necessary_ connection\r\n",
      "between the action and punishment; nor will they believe the\r\n",
      "punishment they suffer to be a consequence of the action they have\r\n",
      "committed, but rather a consequence of their being obliged to submit\r\n",
      "to the will of those who are stronger or more powerful than they are\r\n",
      "themselves. Unjust punishments do not effect their intended purpose,\r\n",
      "because the pain is not associated with the action which we would\r\n",
      "prohibit; but, on the contrary, it is associated with the idea of our\r\n",
      "tyranny; it consequently excites the sentiment of hatred towards us,\r\n",
      "instead of aversion to the forbidden action. When once, by reasoning,\r\n",
      "children acquire even a vague idea that those who educate them are\r\n",
      "unjust, it is in vain either to punish or reward them; if they submit,\r\n",
      "or if they rebel, their education is equally spoiled; in the one case\r\n",
      "they become cowardly, in the other, headstrong. To avoid these evils,\r\n",
      "there is but one method; we must early secure reason for our friend,\r\n",
      "else she will become our unconquerable enemy. As soon as children are\r\n",
      "able, in any instance, to understand the meaning and nature of\r\n",
      "punishment, it should, in that instance, be explained to them. Just\r\n",
      "punishment is pain, inflicted with the reasonable hope of preventing\r\n",
      "greater pain in future. In a family, where there are several children\r\n",
      "educated together, or in public schools, punishments may be inflicted\r\n",
      "with justice for the sake of example, but still the reformation and\r\n",
      "future good of the sufferer is always a principal object; and of this\r\n",
      "he should be made sensible. If our practice upon all occasions\r\n",
      "correspond with our theory, and if children really perceive, that we\r\n",
      "do not punish them to gratify our own spleen or passion, we shall not\r\n",
      "become, even when we give them pain, objects of their hatred. The pain\r\n",
      "will not be associated with us, but, as it ought to be, with the fault\r\n",
      "which was the real cause of it. As much as possible we should let\r\n",
      "children feel the natural consequences of their own conduct. The\r\n",
      "natural consequence of speaking truth, is the being believed; the\r\n",
      "natural consequence of falsehood, is the loss of trust and confidence;\r\n",
      "the natural consequence of all the useful virtues, is esteem; of all\r\n",
      "the amiable virtues, love; of each of the prudential virtues, some\r\n",
      "peculiar advantage to their possessor. But plum-pudding is not the\r\n",
      "appropriate reward of truth, nor is the loss of it the natural or\r\n",
      "necessary consequence of falsehood. Prudence is not to be rewarded\r\n",
      "with the affection due to humanity, nor is humanity to be recompensed\r\n",
      "with the esteem claimed by prudence. Let each good and bad quality\r\n",
      "have its proper share of praise and blame, and let the consequences of\r\n",
      "each follow as constantly as possible. That young people may form a\r\n",
      "steady judgment of the danger of any vice, they must uniformly\r\n",
      "perceive, that certain painful consequences result from its practice.\r\n",
      "It is in vain that we inflict punishments, unless all the precepts and\r\n",
      "all the examples which they see, confirm them in the same belief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the unfortunate son of Peter the Great, we have a striking instance\r\n",
      "of the effects of a disagreement between precept and example,[63]\r\n",
      "which, in a less elevated situation, might have escaped our notice. It\r\n",
      "seems as if the different parts and stages of his education had been\r\n",
      "purposely contrived to counteract each other. Till he was eleven years\r\n",
      "old, he was committed to the care of women, and of ignorant bigotted\r\n",
      "priests, who were continually inveighing against his father for the\r\n",
      "abolition of certain barbarous customs. Then came baron Huysen for his\r\n",
      "governour, a sensible man, who had just begun to make something of his\r\n",
      "pupil, when prince Menzikof insisted upon having the sole management\r\n",
      "of the unfortunate Alexey. Prince Menzikof abandoned him to the\r\n",
      "company of the lowest wretches, who encouraged him in continual\r\n",
      "ebriety, and in a taste for every thing mean and profligate. At length\r\n",
      "came Euphrosyne, his Finlandish mistress, who, upon his trial for\r\n",
      "rebellion, deposed to every angry expression which, in his most\r\n",
      "unguarded moments, the wretched son had uttered against the tyrannical\r\n",
      "father. Amidst such scenes of contradictory experience, can we be\r\n",
      "surprised, that Alexey Petrovitch became feeble, ignorant, and\r\n",
      "profligate; that he rebelled against the father whom he had early been\r\n",
      "taught to fear and hate; that he listened to the pernicious counsels\r\n",
      "of the companions who had, by pretended sympathy and flattery,\r\n",
      "obtained that place in his confidence which no parental kindness had\r\n",
      "ever secured? Those historians who are zealous for the glory of Peter\r\n",
      "the Great, have eagerly refuted, as a most atrocious calumny, the\r\n",
      "report of his having had any part in the mysterious death of his son.\r\n",
      "But how will they apologize for the Czar's neglect of that son's\r\n",
      "education, from which all the misfortunes of his life arose?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But all this is past for ever; the only advantage we can gain from\r\n",
      "recalling these circumstances, is a confirmation of this important\r\n",
      "principle in education; that, when precept and example counteract one\r\n",
      "another, there is no hope of success. Nor can the utmost severity\r\n",
      "effect any useful purpose, whilst the daily experience of the pupil\r\n",
      "contradicts his preceptor's lessons. In fact, severity is seldom\r\n",
      "necessary in a well conducted education. The smallest possible degree\r\n",
      "of pain, which can, in any case, produce the required effect, is\r\n",
      "indisputably the just measure of the punishment which ought to be\r\n",
      "inflicted in any given case. This simple axiom will lead us to a\r\n",
      "number of truths, which immediately depend upon, or result from it. We\r\n",
      "must attend to every circumstance which can diminish the quantity of\r\n",
      "pain, without lessening the efficacy of punishment. Now it has been\r\n",
      "found from experience, that there are several circumstances which\r\n",
      "operate uniformly to this purpose. We formerly observed, that the\r\n",
      "effect of punishment upon the minds of children, before they reason,\r\n",
      "depends much upon its _immediately_ succeeding the fault, and also\r\n",
      "upon its being certainly repeated whenever the same fault is\r\n",
      "committed. After children acquire the power of reasoning, from a\r\n",
      "variety of new motives, these laws, with respect to punishment, derive\r\n",
      "additional force. A trifling degree of pain will answer the purpose,\r\n",
      "if it be made inevitable; whilst the fear of an enormous proportion of\r\n",
      "uncertain punishment, will not be found sufficient to govern the\r\n",
      "imagination. The contemplation of a distant punishment, however\r\n",
      "severe, does not affect the imagination with much terror, because\r\n",
      "there is still a secret hope of escape in the mind. Hence it is found\r\n",
      "from experience, that the most sanguinary penal laws have always been\r\n",
      "ineffectual to restrain from crimes.[64] Even if detection be\r\n",
      "inevitable, and consequent punishment equally inevitable, if\r\n",
      "punishment be not inflicted as soon as the criminal is convicted, it\r\n",
      "has been found that it has not, either as a preventative, or a public\r\n",
      "example, the same power upon the human mind. Not only should the\r\n",
      "punishment be immediate after conviction, but detection should follow\r\n",
      "the offence as speedily as possible. Without entering at large into\r\n",
      "the intricate arguments concerning identity and consciousness, we may\r\n",
      "observe, that the consciousness of having committed the offence for\r\n",
      "which he suffers, ought, at the time of suffering, to be strong in the\r\n",
      "offender's mind. Though proofs of his identity may have been legally\r\n",
      "established in a court of justice; and though, as far as it relates to\r\n",
      "public justice, it matters not whether the offence for which he is\r\n",
      "punished has been committed yesterday or a year ago; yet, as to the\r\n",
      "effect which the punishment produces on the culprit's own mind, there\r\n",
      "must be a material difference.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I desire you to judge of me, not by what I was, but by what I am,\"\r\n",
      "said a philosopher, when he was reproached for some of his past\r\n",
      "transgressions. If the interval between an offence and its punishment\r\n",
      "be long, it is possible that, during this interval, a complete change\r\n",
      "may be made in the views and habits of the offender; such a change as\r\n",
      "shall absolutely preclude all probability of his repeating his\r\n",
      "offence. His punishment must then be purely for the sake of example to\r\n",
      "others. He suffers pain at the time, perhaps, when he is in the best\r\n",
      "social dispositions possible; and thus we punish the present good man\r\n",
      "for the faults of the former offender. We readily excuse the violence\r\n",
      "which a man in a passion may have committed, when, upon his return to\r\n",
      "his sober senses, he expresses contrition and surprise at his own\r\n",
      "excesses; he assures us, and we believe him, that he is now a\r\n",
      "perfectly different person. If we do not feel any material ill\r\n",
      "consequences from his late anger, we are willing, and even desirous,\r\n",
      "that the passionate man should not, in his sober state, be punished\r\n",
      "for his madness; all that we can desire, is to have some security\r\n",

      "was seldom legal. The commisioners complained, and the legislators\r\n",
      "went to work again. Under a penalty of one hundred pounds, distillers\r\n",
      "were ordered to paint the words _distiller, dealer in spirits_, over\r\n",

      "governing them with the least possible pain. But with fear they excite\r\n",
      "all the passions and habits which are connected with that mean\r\n",
      "principle of action, and they extinguish that vigorous spirit, that\r\n",

      "little, and is soon forgotten.\"[69] It cannot be doubted, that the\r\n",
      "expression of indignation is a just consequence of certain faults, and\r\n",
      "the general indignation with which these are spoken of before young\r\n",
      "people, must make a strong and useful impression upon their minds.\r\n",
      "They reflect upon the actions of others; they see the effects which\r\n",
      "these produce upon the human mind; they put themselves in the\r\n",
      "situation alternately of the person who expresses indignation, and of\r\n",
      "him who suffers shame; they measure the fault and its consequences,\r\n",
      "and they resolve to conduct themselves so as to avoid that just\r\n",
      "indignation of which they dread to be the object. These are the\r\n",
      "general conclusions which children draw when they are _impartial\r\n",
      "spectators_; but where they are themselves concerned, their feelings\r\n",
      "and their reasonings are very different. If they have done any thing\r\n",
      "which they know to be wrong, they expect, and are sensible that they\r\n",
      "deserve, displeasure and indignation; but if any precise penalty is\r\n",
      "annexed to the fault, the person who is to inflict it, appears to them\r\n",
      "in the character of a judge, who is bound to repress his own feelings,\r\n",
      "and coolly to execute justice. If the judge both reproaches and\r\n",
      "punishes, he doubles the punishment. Whenever indignation is\r\n",
      "expressed, no vulgar trivial penalties should accompany it; the pupil\r\n",
      "should feel that it is indignation against his fault, and not against\r\n",
      "himself; and that it is not excited in his preceptor's mind by any\r\n",
      "petty personal considerations. A child distinguishes between anger and\r\n",
      "indignation very exactly; the one commands his respect, the other\r\n",
      "raises his contempt as soon as his fears subside. Dr. Priestley seems\r\n",
      "to think that, \"it is not possible to express displeasure with\r\n",
      "sufficient _force_, especially to a child, when a man is perfectly\r\n",
      "cool.\" May we not reply to this, that it is scarcely possible to\r\n",
      "express displeasure with sufficient _propriety_, especially to a\r\n",
      "child, when a man is in a passion? The propriety is, in this case, of\r\n",
      "at least as much consequence as the force of the reprimand.--The\r\n",
      "effect which the preceptor's displeasure will produce, must be, in\r\n",
      "some proportion, to the esteem which his pupil feels for him. If he\r\n",
      "cannot command his irascible passions, his pupil cannot continue to\r\n",
      "esteem him; and there is an end of all that fear of his\r\n",
      "disapprobation, which was founded upon esteem, and which can never be\r\n",
      "founded upon a stronger or a better basis. We should further consider,\r\n",
      "that the opinions of all the bystanders, especially if they be any of\r\n",
      "them of the pupil's own age, have great influence upon his mind. It is\r\n",
      "not to be expected that they should all sympathize equally with the\r\n",
      "angry preceptor; and we know, that whenever the indignation expressed\r\n",
      "against any fault, appears, in the least, to pass the bound of exact\r\n",
      "justice, the sympathy of the spectators immediately revolts in favour\r\n",
      "of the culprit; the fault is forgotten or excused, and all join in\r\n",
      "spontaneous compassion. In public schools, this happens so frequently,\r\n",
      "that the master's displeasure seldom affects the little community with\r\n",
      "any sorrow; combined together, they make each other amends for public\r\n",
      "punishments, by private pity or encouragement. In families, which are\r\n",
      "not well regulated, that is to say, in which the interests of all the\r\n",
      "individuals do not coalesce, the same evils are to be dreaded. Neither\r\n",
      "indignation nor _shame_ can affect children in such schools, or such\r\n",

      "attitudes the very reverse of those which they have practised with so\r\n",

      "there is a continual struggle between these. They find it impossible\r\n",
      "to correct, instantaneously, the awkward tricks which they have\r\n",

      "Every preventative which is discovered for any defect, either in\r\n",

      "children who have been reasonably and affectionately educated,\r\n",
      "scarcely any punishments are requisite. This is not an assertion\r\n",
      "hazarded without experience; the happy experience of several years,\r\n",
      "and of several children of different ages and tempers, justifies this\r\n",
      "assertion. As for corporeal punishments, they may be necessary where\r\n",
      "boys are to be _drilled_ in a given time into scholars; but the\r\n",
      "language of blows need seldom be used to reasonable creatures. The\r\n",
      "idea that it is disgraceful to be governed by force, should be kept\r\n",
      "alive in the minds of children; the dread of shame is a more powerful\r\n",
      "motive than the fear of bodily pain. To prove the truth of this, we\r\n",
      "may recollect that few people have ever been known to destroy\r\n",
      "themselves in order to escape from bodily pain; but numbers, to avoid\r\n",
      "shame, have put an end to their existence. It has been a question,\r\n",
      "whether mankind are most governed by hope or by fear, by rewards or by\r\n",
      "punishments? This question, like many others which have occasioned\r\n",
      "tedious debates, turns chiefly upon words. Hope and fear are sometimes\r\n",
      "used to denote mixed, and sometimes unmixed, passions. Those who speak\r\n",
      "of them as unmixed passions, cannot have accurately examined their own\r\n",
      "feelings.[75] The probability of good, produces hope; the probability\r\n",
      "of evil, excites fear; and as this probability appears less or\r\n",
      "greater, more remote or nearer to us, the mind fluctuates between the\r\n",
      "opposite passions. When the probability increases on either side, so\r\n",
      "does the corresponding passion. Since these passions seldom exist in\r\n",
      "absolute separation from one another, it appears that we cannot\r\n",
      "philosophically speak of either as an independent motive: to the\r\n",
      "question, therefore, \"which governs mankind the most, hope or fear?\"\r\n",
      "we cannot give an explicit answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we would determine upon the probability of any good or evil, we\r\n",
      "are insensibly influenced, not only by the view of the circumstances\r\n",
      "before us, but also by our previous habits; we judge not only by the\r\n",
      "general laws of human events, but also by our own individual\r\n",
      "experience. If we have been usually successful, we are inclined to\r\n",
      "hope; have we been accustomed to misfortunes, we are hence disposed to\r\n",
      "fear. \"Cæsar and his fortune are on board,\" exclaimed the confident\r\n",
      "hero to the mariners. Hope excites the mind to exertion; fear\r\n",
      "represses all activity. As a preventative from vice, you may employ\r\n",
      "fear; to restrain the excesses of all the furious passions, it is\r\n",
      "useful and necessary: but would you rouse the energies of virtue, you\r\n",
      "must inspire and invigorate the soul with hope. Courage, generosity,\r\n",
      "industry, perseverance, all the magic of talents, all the powers of\r\n",
      "genius, all the virtues that appear spontaneous in great minds, spring\r\n",
      "from hope. But how different is the hope of a great and of a little\r\n",
      "mind; not only are the objects of this hope different, but the passion\r\n",
      "itself is raised and supported in a different manner. A feeble person,\r\n",
      "if he presumes to hope, hopes as superstitiously as he fears; he keeps\r\n",
      "his attention sedulously fixed upon all the probabilities in his\r\n",
      "favour; he will not listen to any arguments in opposition to his\r\n",
      "wishes; he knows he is unreasonable, he persists in continuing so; he\r\n",
      "does not connect any idea of exertion with hope; his hope usually\r\n",
      "rests upon the exertions of others, or upon some fortuitous\r\n",
      "circumstances. A man of a strong mind, reasons before he hopes; he\r\n",
      "takes in, at one quick, comprehensive glance, all that is to be seen\r\n",
      "both for and against him; he is, from experience, disposed to depend\r\n",
      "much upon his own exertions, if they can turn the balance in his\r\n",
      "favour; he hopes, he acts, he succeeds. Poets, in all ages, have\r\n",
      "celebrated the charms of hope; without her propitious influence, life,\r\n",
      "they tell us, would be worse than death; without her smiles, nature\r\n",
      "would smile in vain; without her promises, treacherous though they\r\n",
      "often prove, reality would have nothing to give worthy of our\r\n",
      "acceptance. We are not bound, however, to understand literally, the\r\n",
      "rhetoric of poets. Hope is to them a beautiful and useful allegorical\r\n",
      "personage: sometimes leaning upon an anchor; sometimes \"waving her\r\n",
      "golden hair;\" always young, smiling, enchanting, furnished with a rich\r\n",
      "assortment of epithets suited to the ode, the sonnet, the madrigal,\r\n",
      "with a traditionary number of images and allusions; what more can a\r\n",
      "poet desire? Men, except when they are poets, do not value hope as the\r\n",
      "first of terrestrial blessings. The action and energies which hope\r\n",
      "produces, are to many more agreeable than the passion itself; that\r\n",
      "feverish state of suspense, which prevents settled thought or vigorous\r\n",
      "exertion, far from being agreeable, is highly painful to a well\r\n",
      "regulated mind; the continued repetition of the same ideas and the\r\n",
      "same calculations, fatigues the mind, which, in reasoning, has been\r\n",
      "accustomed to arrive at some certain conclusion, or to advance, at\r\n",
      "least, a step at every effort. The exercise of the mind, in changing\r\n",
      "the views of its object, which is supposed to be a great part of the\r\n",
      "pleasure of hope, is soon over to an active imagination, which quickly\r\n",
      "runs through all the possible changes; or is this exercise, even while\r\n",
      "it lasts, so delightful to a man who has a variety of intellectual\r\n",
      "occupations, as it frequently appears to him who knows scarcely any\r\n",
      "other species of mental activity? The vacillating state of mind,\r\n",
      "peculiar to hope and fear, is by no means favourable to industry; half\r\n",
      "our time is generally consumed in speculating upon the reward, instead\r\n",
      "of earning it, whenever the value of that reward is not _precisely\r\n",
      "ascertainable_. In all occupations, where judgment or accurate\r\n",
      "observation is essential, if the reward of our labour is brought\r\n",
      "suddenly to excite our hope, there is an immediate interruption of all\r\n",
      "effectual labour; the thoughts take a new direction; the mind becomes\r\n",

      "\"Let me have the money, and I'll give you the buckles.\" It was done\r\n",
      "accordingly, says Lord Kames. The earl, inquiring privately, found\r\n",
      "that the money was given to the lad _who had no dinner_. The buckles\r\n",
      "were returned, and the boy was highly commended for being kind to his\r\n",
      "companion. The commendations were just, but the buckles should not\r\n",
      "have been returned: the boy should have been suffered steadily to\r\n",

      "attempt to teach them what is false. If we once make them amends for\r\n",
      "any sacrifice they have made, we lead them to expect the same\r\n",
      "remuneration upon a future occasion; and then, in fact, they act with\r\n",
      "a direct view to their own interest, and govern themselves by the\r\n",
      "calculations of prudence, instead of following the dictates of\r\n",
      "benevolence. It is true, that if we speak with accuracy, we must\r\n",

      "change the meaning of words when we talk of its being selfish to like\r\n",
      "the pleasures of sympathy or benevolence, because these pleasures\r\n",
      "cannot be confined solely to the idea of self. When we say that a\r\n",
      "person pursues his own interest more by being generous than by being\r\n",
      "covetous, we take into the account the general sum of his agreeable\r\n",
      "feelings; we do not balance prudentially his loss or gain upon\r\n",
      "particular occasions. The generous man may himself be convinced, that\r\n",
      "the sum of his happiness is more increased by the feelings of\r\n",

      "does not occur to his memory in the form of a prudential aphorism,\r\n",
      "whenever he is going to do a generous action. It is essential to our\r\n",

      "associated with a number of enthusiastic ideas; we can sympathize with\r\n",
      "the virtuous insanity of the man who forgets himself whilst he thinks\r\n",
      "of others; we do not so readily sympathize with the cold strength of\r\n",

      "with different habits. By early associating the pleasures of sympathy,\r\n",
      "and praise, and affection with all generous and benevolent actions,\r\n",
      "his parents might have joined these ideas so forcibly in his mind,\r\n",
      "that the one set of ideas should never recur without the other.\r\n",
      "Whenever the words benevolence or generosity were pronounced, the\r\n",
      "feelings of habitual pleasure would recur; and he would, independently\r\n",
      "of reason, desire from association to be generous. When enthusiasm is\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The artless expressions of sympathy and sensibility in children, are\r\n",
      "peculiarly pleasing; people who, in their commerce with the world,\r\n",
      "have been disgusted and deceived by falsehood and affectation, listen\r\n",
      "with delight to the genuine language of nature. Those who have any\r\n",
      "interest in the education of children, have yet a higher sense of\r\n",
      "pleasure in observing symptoms of their sensibility; they anticipate\r\n",
      "the future virtues which early sensibility seems certainly to promise;\r\n",
      "the future happiness which these virtues will diffuse. Nor are they\r\n",
      "unsupported by philosophy in these sanguine hopes. No theory was ever\r\n",
      "developed with more ingenious elegance, than that which deduces all\r\n",
      "our moral sentiments from sympathy. The direct influence of sympathy\r\n",
      "upon all social beings, is sufficiently obvious, and we immediately\r\n",
      "perceive its necessary connection with compassion, friendship, and\r\n",
      "benevolence; but the subject becomes more intricate when we are to\r\n",
      "analyse our sense of propriety and justice; of merit and demerit; of\r\n",
      "gratitude and resentment; self-complacency or remorse; ambition and\r\n",
      "shame.[78]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We allow, without hesitation, that a being destitute of sympathy,\r\n",
      "could never have any of these feelings, and must, consequently, be\r\n",
      "incapable of all intercourse with society; yet we must at the same\r\n",
      "time perceive, that a being endowed with the most exquisite sympathy,\r\n",
      "must, without the assistance and education of reason, be, if not\r\n",
      "equally incapable of social intercourse, far more dangerous to the\r\n",
      "happiness of society. A person governed by sympathy alone, must be\r\n",
      "influenced by the bad as well as by the good passions of others; he\r\n",
      "must feel resentment with the angry man; hatred with the malevolent;\r\n",
      "jealousy with the jealous; and avarice with the miser: the more lively\r\n",
      "his sympathy with these painful feelings, the greater must be his\r\n",
      "misery; the more forcibly he is impelled to action by this sympathetic\r\n",
      "influence, the greater, probably, must be his imprudence and his\r\n",
      "guilt. Let us even suppose a being capable of sympathy only with the\r\n",
      "best feelings of his fellow-creatures, still, without the direction of\r\n",
      "reason, he would be a nuisance in the world; his pity would stop the\r\n",
      "hand, and overturn the balance of justice; his love would be as\r\n",
      "dangerous as his pity; his gratitude would exalt his benefactor at the\r\n",
      "expense of the whole human race; his sympathy with the rich, the\r\n",
      "prosperous, the great, and the fortunate, would be so sudden, and so\r\n",
      "violent, as to leave him no time for reflection upon the consequences\r\n",
      "of tyranny, or the miseries occasioned by monopoly. No time for\r\n",
      "reflection, did we say? We forgot that we were speaking of a being\r\n",
      "destitute of the reasoning faculty! Such a being, no matter what his\r\n",
      "virtuous sympathies might be, must act either like a madman or a fool.\r\n",
      "On sympathy we cannot depend, either for the correctness of a man's\r\n",
      "moral sentiments, or for the steadiness of his moral conduct. It is\r\n",
      "very common to talk of the excellence of a person's heart, of the\r\n",
      "natural goodness of his disposition; when these expressions distinctly\r\n",
      "mean any thing, they must refer to natural sympathy, or a superior\r\n",
      "degree of sensibility. Experience, however, does not teach us, that\r\n",
      "sensibility and virtue have any certain connection with each other. No\r\n",
      "one can read the works of Sterne, or of Rousseau, without believing\r\n",
      "these men to have been endowed with extraordinary sensibility; yet,\r\n",
      "who would propose their conduct in life as a model for imitation? That\r\n",
      "quickness of sympathy with present objects of distress, which\r\n",

      "sympathy and sensibility; even their vices frequently prove to us,\r\n",
      "that they never became utterly indifferent to the opinion and feelings\r\n",
      "of their fellow-creatures. The dissimulation, jealousy, suspicion,\r\n",
      "and cruelty of Tiberius, originated, perhaps, more in his anxiety\r\n",

      "in our success, or in the pleasure we feel in superiority. The desire\r\n",
      "for this refined modification of sympathy, may be the motive of good\r\n",
      "and great actions; but it cannot be trusted as a moral principle.\r\n",
      "Nero's love of sympathy, made him anxious to be applauded on the stage\r\n",

      "improved both in sense and language. This unmerited loss of their late\r\n",
      "gratuitous allowance of sympathy, usually operates unfavourably upon\r\n",
      "the temper of the sufferers; they become shy and silent, and reserved,\r\n",
      "if not sullen; they withdraw from our capricious society, and they\r\n",
      "endeavour to console themselves with other pleasures. It is difficult\r\n",
      "to them to feel contented with their own little occupations and\r\n",
      "amusements, for want of the spectators and the audience which used to\r\n",
      "be at their command. Children of a timid temper, or of an indolent\r\n",
      "disposition, are quite dispirited and bereft of all energy in these\r\n",
      "circumstances; others, with greater vivacity, and more voluntary\r\n",
      "exertion, endeavour to supply the loss of universal sympathy, by the\r\n",
      "invention of independent occupations; but they feel anger and\r\n",
      "indignation, when they are not rewarded with any smiles or any praise\r\n",
      "for their \"virtuous toil.\" They naturally seek for new companions,\r\n",
      "either amongst children of their own age, or amongst complaisant\r\n",
      "servants. Immediately all the business of education is at a stand; for\r\n",
      "neither these servants, nor these playfellows, are capable of becoming\r\n",
      "their instructers; nor can tutors hope to succeed, who have\r\n",
      "transferred their power over the pleasures, and consequently over the\r\n",
      "affections of their pupils. Sympathy now becomes the declared enemy of\r\n",

      "of happiness, under such a government?\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Instead of lavishing our smiles and our attention upon young children\r\n",
      "for a short period, just at that age when they are amusing playthings,\r\n",
      "should we not do more wisely if we reserved some portion of our\r\n",
      "kindness a few years longer? By a proper _economy_, our sympathy may\r\n",
      "last for many years, and may continually contribute to the most useful\r\n",
      "purposes. Instead of accustoming our pupils early to such a degree of\r\n",
      "our attention as cannot be supported long on our parts, we should\r\n",
      "rather suffer them to feel a little ennui, at that age when they can\r\n",
      "have but few independent or useful occupations. We should employ\r\n",
      "ourselves in our usual manner, and converse, without allowing children\r\n",
      "to interrupt us with frivolous prattle; but whenever they ask sensible\r\n",
      "questions, make just observations, or show a disposition to acquire\r\n",
      "knowledge, we should assist and encourage them with praise and\r\n",
      "affection; gradually as they become capable of taking any part in\r\n",
      "conversation, they should be admitted into society, and they will\r\n",
      "learn of themselves, or we may teach them, that useful and agreeable\r\n",
      "qualities are those by which they must secure the pleasures of\r\n",
      "sympathy. Esteem, being associated with sympathy, will increase its\r\n",
      "value, and this connection should be made as soon, and kept as sacred,\r\n",
      "in the mind as possible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With respect to the sympathy which children feel for each other, it\r\n",
      "must be carefully managed, or it will counteract, instead of assisting\r\n",
      "us, in education. It is natural, that those who are placed nearly in\r\n",
      "the same circumstances, should feel alike, and sympathize with one\r\n",
      "another; but children feel only for the present; they have few ideas\r\n",
      "of the future; and consequently all that they can desire, either for\r\n",
      "themselves, or for their companions, is what will _immediately_\r\n",
      "please. Education looks to the future, and frequently we must ensure\r\n",
      "future advantage, even at the expense of present pain or restraint.\r\n",
      "The companion and the tutor then, supposing each to be equally good\r\n",
      "and equally kind, must command, in a very different degree, the\r\n",
      "sympathy of the child. It may, notwithstanding, be questioned, whether\r\n",
      "those who are constant companions in their idle hours, when they are\r\n",
      "_very_ young, are likely to be either as fond of one another when they\r\n",
      "grow up, or even as happy whilst they are children, as those are who\r\n",
      "spend less time together. Whenever the humours, interests, and\r\n",
      "passions of others cross our own, there is an end of sympathy, and\r\n",
      "this happens almost every hour in the day with children; it is\r\n",
      "generally supposed, that they learn to live in friendship with each\r\n",
      "other, and to bear with one another's little faults habitually; that\r\n",
      "they even reciprocally cure these faults, and learn, by experience,\r\n",
      "those principles of honour and justice on which society depends. We\r\n",
      "may be deceived in this reasoning by a false analogy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We call the society of children, _society in miniature_; the\r\n",
      "proportions of the miniature are so much altered, that it is by no\r\n",
      "means an accurate resemblance of that which exists in the _civilized_\r\n",
      "world. Amongst children of different ages, strength, and talents,\r\n",
      "there must always be tyranny, injustice, and that worst species of\r\n",
      "inequality, which arises from superior force on the one side, and\r\n",
      "abject timidity on the other. Of this, the spectators of juvenile\r\n",
      "disputes and quarrels are sometimes sensible, and they hastily\r\n",
      "interfere and endeavour to part the combatants, by pronouncing certain\r\n",
      "moral sentences, such as, \"Good boys never quarrel; brothers must\r\n",
      "love and help one another.\" But these sentences seldom operate as a\r\n",
      "charm upon the angry passions; the parties concerned, hearing it\r\n",
      "asserted that they must love one another, at the very instant when\r\n",
      "they happen to feel that they cannot, are still further exasperated,\r\n",
      "and they stand at bay, sullen in hatred, or approach hypocritical in\r\n",
      "reconciliation. It is more easy to prevent occasions of dispute, than\r\n",
      "to remedy the bad consequences which petty altercations produce. Young\r\n",
      "children should be kept asunder at all times, and in all situations,\r\n",
      "in which it is necessary, or probable, that their appetites and\r\n",
      "passions should be in direct competition. Two hungry children, with\r\n",
      "their eager eyes fixed upon one and the same bason of bread and milk,\r\n",
      "do not sympathize with each other, though they have the same\r\n",
      "sensations; each perceives, that if the other eats the bread and milk,\r\n",
      "he cannot eat it. Hunger is more powerful than sympathy; but satisfy\r\n",
      "the hunger of one of the parties, and immediately he will begin to\r\n",
      "feel for his companion, and will wish that _his_ hunger should also be\r\n",
      "satisfied. Even Mr. Barnet, the epicure, who is so well described in\r\n",
      "Moore's excellent novel,[80] _after_ he has crammed himself to the\r\n",
      "throat, asks his wife to \"try to eat a bit.\" Intelligent preceptors\r\n",
      "will apply the instance of the bason of bread and milk, in a variety\r\n",
      "of apparently dissimilar circumstances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We may observe, that the more quickly children reason, the sooner they\r\n",
      "discover how far their interests are any ways incompatible with the\r\n",
      "interests of their companions. The more readily a boy calculates, the\r\n",
      "sooner he will perceive, that if he were to share his bason of bread\r\n",
      "and milk equally with a dozen of his companions, his own portion must\r\n",
      "be small. The accuracy of his mental division would prevent him from\r\n",
      "offering to part with that share which, perhaps, a more ignorant\r\n",
      "accountant would be ready to surrender at once, without being on that\r\n",
      "account more generous. Children, who are accurate observers of the\r\n",
      "countenance, and who have a superior degree of penetration, discover\r\n",
      "very early the symptoms of displeasure, or of affection, in their\r\n",
      "friends; they also perceive quickly the dangers of rivalship from\r\n",
      "their companions. If experience convinces them, that they must lose in\r\n",
      "proportion as their companions gain, either in fame or in favour, they\r\n",
      "will necessarily dislike them as rivals; their hatred will be as\r\n",
      "vehement, as their love of praise and affection is ardent. Thus\r\n",
      "children, who have the most lively sympathy, are, unless they be\r\n",
      "judiciously educated, the most in danger of feeling early the\r\n",
      "malevolent passions of jealousy and envy. It is inhuman, and in every\r\n",
      "point of view unjustifiable in us, to excite these painful feelings in\r\n",
      "children, as we too often do, by the careless or partial distribution\r\n",
      "of affection and applause. Exact justice will best prevent jealousy;\r\n",
      "each individual submits to justice, because each, in turn, feels the\r\n",
      "benefit of its protection. Some preceptors, with benevolent\r\n",
      "intentions, labour to preserve a perfect equality amongst their\r\n",
      "pupils, and, from the fear of exciting envy in those who are inferior,\r\n",
      "avoid uttering any encomiums upon superior talents and merit. This\r\n",
      "management seldom succeeds; the truth cannot be concealed; those who\r\n",
      "feel their own superiority, make painful reflections upon the\r\n",
      "injustice done to them by the policy of their tutors; those who are\r\n",
      "sensible of their own inferiority, are not comforted by the courtesy\r\n",
      "and humiliating forbearance with which they are treated. It is,\r\n",
      "therefore, best to speak the plain truth; to give to all their due\r\n",
      "share of affection and applause: at the same time, we should avoid\r\n",
      "blaming one child at the moment when we praise another: we should\r\n",
      "never put our pupils in contrast with one another; nor yet should we\r\n",
      "deceive them as to their respective excellences and defects. Our\r\n",
      "comparison should rather be made between what the pupil _has been_,\r\n",
      "and what he _is_, than between what he _is_, and what any body else\r\n",
      "_is not_.[81] By this style of praise we may induce children to become\r\n",
      "emulous of their former selves, instead of being envious of their\r\n",
      "competitors. Without deceit or affectation, we may also take care to\r\n",
      "associate general pleasure in a family with particular commendations:\r\n",
      "thus, if one boy is remarkable for prudence, and another for\r\n",
      "generosity, we should not praise the generosity of the one at the\r\n",
      "expense of the prudence of the other, but we should give to each\r\n",
      "virtue its just measure of applause. If one girl sings, and another\r\n",
      "draws, remarkably well, we may show that we are pleased with both\r\n",
      "agreeable accomplishments, without bringing them into comparison. Nor\r\n",
      "is it necessary that we should be in a desperate hurry to balance the\r\n",
      "separate degrees of praise which we distribute exactly at the same\r\n",
      "moment, because if children are sure that the reward of their industry\r\n",
      "and ingenuity is secured by our justice, they will trust to us, though\r\n",
      "that reward may be for a few hours delayed. It is only where workmen\r\n",
      "have no confidence in the integrity or punctuality of their masters,\r\n",
      "that they are impatient of any accidental delay in the payment of\r\n",
      "their wages.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With the precautions which have been mentioned, we may hope to see\r\n",
      "children grow up in real friendship together. The whole sum of their\r\n",
      "pleasure is much increased by mutual sympathy. This happy moral truth,\r\n",
      "upon which so many of our virtues depend, should be impressed upon the\r\n",
      "mind; it should be clearly demonstrated to the reason; it should not\r\n",
      "be repeated as an a priori, sentimental assertion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Those who have observed the sudden, violent, and surprising effects of\r\n",
      "emulation in public schools, will regret the want of this _power_ in\r\n",
      "the intellectual education of their pupils at home. Even the\r\n",
      "acquisition of talents and knowledge ought, however, to be but a\r\n",
      "secondary consideration, subordinate to the general happiness of our\r\n",
      "pupils. If we _could_ have superior knowledge, upon condition that we\r\n",
      "should have a malevolent disposition, and an irritable temper, should\r\n",
      "we, setting every other moral consideration aside, be willing to make\r\n",
      "the purchase at such a price? Let any person, desirous to see a\r\n",
      "striking picture of the effects of scholastic competition upon the\r\n",
      "moral character, look at the life of that wonder of his age, the\r\n",
      "celebrated Abeillard. As the taste and manners of the present times\r\n",
      "are so different from those of the age in which he lived, we see,\r\n",
      "without any species of deception, the real value of the learning in\r\n",
      "which he excelled, and we can judge both of his acquirements, and of\r\n",
      "his character, without prejudice. We see him goaded on by rivalship,\r\n",
      "and literary ambition, to astonishing exertions at one time; at\r\n",
      "another, torpid in monkish indolence: at one time, we see him\r\n",
      "intoxicated with adulation; at another, listless, desponding, abject,\r\n",
      "incapable of maintaining his own self-approbation without the\r\n",
      "suffrages of those whom he despised. If his biographer[82] does him\r\n",
      "justice, a more selfish, irritable, contemptible, miserable being,\r\n",
      "than the learned Abeillard, could scarcely exist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A philosopher,[83] who, if we might judge of him by the benignity of\r\n",
      "his writings, was surely of a most amiable and happy temper, has yet\r\n",
      "left us a melancholy and discouraging history of the unsociable\r\n",
      "condition of men of superior knowledge and abilities. He supposes that\r\n",
      "those who have devoted much time to the cultivation of their\r\n",
      "understandings, have habitually less sympathy, or less exercise for\r\n",
      "their sympathy, than those who live less abstracted from the world;\r\n",
      "that, consequently, \"all their social, and all their public\r\n",
      "affections, lose their natural warmth and vigour,\" whilst their\r\n",
      "selfish passions are cherished and strengthened, being kept in\r\n",
      "constant play by literary rivalship. It is to be hoped, that there\r\n",
      "are men of the most extensive learning and genius, now living, who\r\n",
      "could, from their own experience, assure us that those are obsolete\r\n",
      "observations, no longer applicable to modern human nature. At all\r\n",
      "events, we, who refer so much to education, are hopefully of opinion,\r\n",
      "that education can prevent these evils, in common with _almost_ all\r\n",
      "the other evils of life. It would be an errour, fatal to all\r\n",
      "improvement, to believe that the cultivation of the understanding,\r\n",
      "impedes the exercise of the social affections. Obviously, a man, who\r\n",
      "secludes himself from the world, and whose whole life is occupied with\r\n",
      "abstract studies, cannot enjoy any pleasure from his social\r\n",
      "affections; his admiration of the dead, is so constant, that he has no\r\n",
      "time to feel any sympathy with the living. An individual, of this\r\n",
      "ruminating species, is humorously delineated in Mrs. D'Arblay's\r\n",
      "Camilla. Men, who are compelled to unrelenting labour, whether by\r\n",
      "avarice, or by literary ambition, are equally to be pitied. They are\r\n",
      "not models for imitation; they sacrifice their happiness to some\r\n",
      "strong passion or interest. Without this ascetic abstinence from the\r\n",
      "domestic and social pleasures of life, surely persons may cultivate\r\n",
      "their understandings, and acquire, even by mixing with their\r\n",
      "fellow-creatures, a variety of useful knowledge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An ingenious theory[84] supposes the exercise of any of our faculties,\r\n",
      "is always attended with pleasure, which lasts as long as that exercise\r\n",
      "can be continued without fatigue. This pleasure, arising from the due\r\n",
      "exercise of our mental powers, the author of this theory maintains to\r\n",
      "be the foundation of our most agreeable sentiments. If there be any\r\n",
      "truth in these ideas, of how many agreeable sentiments must a man of\r\n",
      "sense be capable! The pleasures of society must to him increase in an\r\n",
      "almost incalculable proportion; because, in conversation, his\r\n",
      "faculties can never want subjects on which they may be amply\r\n",
      "exercised. The dearth of conversation, which every body may have felt\r\n",
      "in certain company, is always attended with mournful countenances, and\r\n",
      "every symptom of ennui. Indeed, without the pleasures of conversation,\r\n",
      "society is reduced to meetings of people, who assemble to eat and\r\n",
      "drink, to show their fine clothes, to weary and to hate one another.\r\n",

      "of dinner, unless they revive, and prolong, by the powers of\r\n",
      "imagination, the memory of the feast. Some foreign traveller[85] tells\r\n",
      "us, that \"every year, at Naples, an officer of the police goes through\r\n",
      "the city, attended by a trumpeter, who proclaims in all the squares\r\n",
      "and cross-ways, how many thousand oxen, calves, lambs, hogs, &c. the\r\n",

      "A degree, and scarcely one degree, above the brute sympathy of good\r\n",
      "eaters, is that gregarious propensity which is sometimes honoured with\r\n",
      "the name of sociability. The current sympathy, or appearance of\r\n",
      "sympathy, which is to be found amongst the idle and frivolous in\r\n",
      "fashionable life, is wholly unconnected with even the idea of esteem.\r\n",
      "It is therefore pernicious to all who partake of it; it excites to no\r\n",
      "great exertions; it rewards neither useful nor amiable qualities: on\r\n",
      "the contrary, it is to be obtained by vice, rather than by virtue; by\r\n",
      "folly much more readily than by wisdom. It is the mere follower of\r\n",
      "fashion, and of dissipation, and it keeps those in humour and\r\n",
      "countenance, who ought to hear the voice of public reproach, and who\r\n",
      "might be roused by the fear of disgrace, or the feelings of shame, to\r\n",

      "companions_; but there is little chance that they should ever become\r\n",
      "any thing more, and there is great danger that they may be led into\r\n",
      "any degree of folly, extravagance, or vice, to which fashion and the\r\n",
      "voice of numbers invite. It sometimes happens, that men of superior\r\n",
      "abilities, have such an indiscriminate love of applause and sympathy,\r\n",
      "that they reduce themselves to the standard of all their casual\r\n",
      "companions, and vary their objects of ambition with the opinion of the\r\n",
      "silly people with whom they chance to associate. In public life, party\r\n",

      "private life, they are addicted to clubs, and associations of all\r\n",
      "sorts, in which the contagion of sympathy has a power which the sober\r\n",
      "influence of reason seldom ventures to correct. The waste of talents,\r\n",
      "and the total loss of principle, to which this indiscriminate love of\r\n",
      "sympathy leads, should warn us to guard against its influence by early\r\n",

      "happiness of our pupils: from sympathy, they catch all the wishes,\r\n",
      "tastes, and ideas of those with whom they associate; and what is still\r\n",
      "worse, they acquire the dangerous habits of resting upon the support,\r\n",
      "and of wanting the stimulus of numbers. It is, surely, far more\r\n",
      "prudent to let children feel a little ennui, from the want of\r\n",
      "occupation and of company, than to purchase for them the juvenile\r\n",
      "pleasures of society at the expense of their future happiness.\r\n",
      "Childhood, as a part of our existence, ought to have as great a share\r\n",
      "of happiness as it can enjoy compatibly with the advantage of the\r\n",
      "other seasons of life. By this principle, we should be guided in all\r\n",

      "of her daughters, who might be about five or six years old. An officer\r\n",
      "of the Saxon guards, who came with me to the play, whispered, 'That\r\n",
      "child will interest you as much as the play.' As soon as she was\r\n",
      "seated, she placed both her hands on the front of the box, fixed her\r\n",
      "eyes upon the stage, and continued with her mouth open, all attention\r\n",
      "to the motions of the actors. It was truly touching to see their\r\n",
      "different passions painted on her face as in a glass. There appeared\r\n",
      "in her countenance successively, anxiety, surprise, melancholy, and\r\n",
      "grief; at length the interest increasing in every scene, tears began\r\n",
      "to flow, which soon ran in abundance down her little cheeks; then came\r\n",
      "agitation, sighs, and loud sobs; at last they were obliged to carry\r\n",
      "her out of the box, lest she should choke herself with crying. My next\r\n",

      "the emotion was not here produced by any theatrical effect. As I was\r\n",
      "walking some years ago in the Pre St. Gervais, at the beginning of\r\n",

      "utmost, standing motionless, and all purple with cold. I addressed\r\n",
      "myself to this woman, who appeared to be ill, and I asked her what was\r\n",
      "the matter with her. Sir, said she, for these three months I have\r\n",
      "suffered terribly from the rheumatism, but my illness troubles me less\r\n",
      "than this child, she never will leave me; if I say to her, Thou art\r\n",

      "these moral topics. No great subtilty of distinction is requisite to\r\n",
      "mark the differences between Vanity and Pride, since those differences\r\n",
      "have been pointed out by every moralist, who has hoped to please\r\n",
      "mankind by an accurate delineation of the failings of human nature.\r\n",
      "Whatever distinctions exist, or may be supposed to exist, between the\r\n",
      "characters in which pride or vanity predominates, it will readily be\r\n",
      "allowed, that there is one thing in which they both agree--they both\r\n",
      "receive pleasure from the approbation of others, and from their own.\r\n",
      "We are disgusted with the vain man, when he intemperately indulges in\r\n",
      "praise of himself, however justly he may be entitled to that praise,\r\n",
      "because he offends against those manners which we have been accustomed\r\n",
      "to think polite, and he claims from us a greater portion of sympathy\r\n",
      "than we can possibly afford to give him. We are not, however, pleased\r\n",
      "by the negligence with which the proud man treats us; we do not like\r\n",
      "to see that he can exist in independent happiness, satisfied with a\r\n",
      "cool internal sense of his own merits; he loses our sympathy, because\r\n",
      "he does not appear to value it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If we could give our pupils exactly the character we wish, what\r\n",
      "degrees of vanity and pride should we desire them to have, and how\r\n",
      "should we regulate these passions? Should we not desire, that their\r\n",
      "ambition to excel might be sufficient to produce the greatest possible\r\n",
      "exertions, directed to the best possible objects; that their opinion\r\n",
      "of themselves should be strictly just, and should never be expressed\r\n",
      "in such a manner as to offend against propriety, or so as to forfeit\r\n",
      "the sympathy of mankind? As to the degree of pleasure which they\r\n",
      "should feel from their secret reflections upon their own meritorious\r\n",
      "conduct, we should certainly desire this to be as lasting, and as\r\n",
      "exquisite, as possible. A considerable portion of the happiness of\r\n",
      "life arises from the sense of self-approbation; we should, therefore,\r\n",
      "secure this gratification in its utmost perfection. We must observe,\r\n",
      "that, however independent the proud man imagines himself to be of the\r\n",

      "observation of what mankind in general, or those whom he particularly\r\n",
      "esteems, think wise or amiable. He must begin then in the same manner\r\n",
      "with the vain man, whom he despises, by collecting the suffrages of\r\n",
      "others; if he selects, with perfect wisdom, the opinions which are\r\n",
      "most just, he forms his character upon excellent principles; and the\r\n",
      "more steadily he abides by his first views, the more he commands and\r\n",
      "obtains respect. But if, unfortunately, he makes a mistake at first,\r\n",
      "his obstinacy in errour is not to be easily corrected, for he is not\r\n",
      "affected by the general voice of disapprobation, nor by the partial\r\n",
      "loss of the common pleasures of sympathy. The vain man, on the\r\n",
      "contrary, is in danger, let him form his first notions of right and\r\n",
      "wrong ever so justly, of changing them when he happens to be in\r\n",
      "society with any persons who do not agree with him in their moral\r\n",
      "opinions, or who refuse him that applause which supports his own\r\n",
      "feeble self-approbation. We must, in education, endeavour to guard\r\n",
      "against these opposite dangers; we must enlighten the understanding,\r\n",
      "to give our pupils the power of forming their rules of conduct\r\n",
      "rightly, and we must give them sufficient strength of mind to abide by\r\n",
      "the principles which they have formed. When we first praise children,\r\n",
      "we must be careful to associate pleasure with those things which are\r\n",
      "really deserving of approbation. If we praise them for beauty, or for\r\n",
      "any happy expressions which entertain us, but which entertain us\r\n",
      "merely as the sprightly nonsense of childhood, we create vanity in the\r\n",
      "minds of our pupils; we give them false ideas of merit, and, if we\r\n",
      "excite them to exertions, they are not exertions directed to any\r\n",
      "valuable objects. Praise is a strong stimulus to industry, if it be\r\n",
      "properly managed; but if we give it in too large and lavish quantities\r\n",
      "early in life, we shall soon find that it loses its effect, and yet\r\n",
      "that the _patient_ languishes for want of the excitation which custom\r\n",
      "has rendered almost essential to his existence. We say the _patient_,\r\n",
      "for this mental languor may be considered entirely as a disease. For\r\n",

      "Children, who are habituated to the daily and hourly food of praise,\r\n",
      "continually require this sustenance unless they are attended to; but\r\n",

      "supply themselves at a single draught with what will quench their\r\n",
      "thirst for many days. The human animal may, perhaps, by education, be\r\n",
      "taught similar foresight and abstinence in the management of his\r\n",
      "thirst for flattery. Young people, who live with persons that seldom\r\n",
      "bestow praise, do not expect that stimulus, and they are content if\r\n",

      "tone of voice, of those whom they wish to please, that they are\r\n",
      "tolerably well satisfied. It is of little consequence by what language\r\n",
      "approbation is conveyed, whether by words, or looks, or by that\r\n",
      "silence which speaks with so much eloquence; but it is of great\r\n",
      "importance that our pupils should set a high value upon the\r\n",
      "expressions of our approbation. They will value it in proportion to\r\n",
      "their esteem and their affection for us; we include in the word\r\n",
      "_esteem_, a belief in our justice, and in our discernment. Expressions\r\n",
      "of affection, associated with praise, not only increase the pleasure,\r\n",
      "but they alter the nature the of that pleasure; and if they gratify\r\n",
      "vanity, they at the same time excite some of the best feelings of the\r\n",
      "heart. The selfishness of vanity is corrected by this association; and\r\n",
      "the two pleasures of sympathy and self-complacency should never, when\r\n",
      "we can avoid it, be separated.\r\n",

      "Children, who are well educated, and who have acquired an habitual\r\n",

      "indifferent to the praise of strangers, or of _common_ acquaintance;\r\n",
      "nor is it probable that this indifference should suddenly be\r\n",
      "conquered, because the greatest part of the pleasure of praise in\r\n",
      "their mind, depends upon the esteem and affection which they feel for\r\n",
      "the persons by whom it is bestowed. Instead of desiring that our\r\n",
      "pupils should entirely repress, in the company of their own family,\r\n",
      "the pleasure which they feel from the praise that is given to them by\r\n",

      "them, by unreasonable severity, and a cold refusal of sympathy, into\r\n",
      "the society of less rigid observers. Those who have an aversion to\r\n",
      "vanity, will not easily bear with its uncultivated intemperance of\r\n",
      "tongue; but they should consider, that much of what disgusts them, is\r\n",
      "owing to the simplicity of childhood, which must be allowed time to\r\n",
      "learn that respect for the feelings of others, which teaches us to\r\n",
      "restrain our own: but we must not be in haste to restrain, lest we\r\n",
      "teach hypocrisy, instead of strength of mind, or real humility. If we\r\n",
      "expect that children should excel, and should not know that they\r\n",
      "excel, we expect impossibilities; we expect at the same time,\r\n",
      "intelligence and stupidity. If we desire that they should be excited\r\n",
      "by praise, and that, at the same time, they should feel no pleasure in\r\n",
      "the applause which they have earned, we desire things that are\r\n",
      "incompatible. If we encourage children to be frank and sincere, and\r\n",
      "yet, at the same time, reprove them whenever they naturally express\r\n",
      "their opinions of themselves, or the pleasurable feelings of\r\n",
      "self-approbation, we shall counteract our own wishes. Instead of\r\n",
      "hastily blaming children for the sincere and simple expression of\r\n",
      "their self-complacency, or of their desire for the approbation of\r\n",

      "vanity, in fact are well repaid for the constraint which they put upon\r\n",
      "themselves, by the superior degree of respect and sympathy which they\r\n",
      "obtain; that vain people effectually counteract their own wishes, and\r\n",
      "meet with contempt, instead of admiration. By appealing constantly,\r\n",
      "when we praise, to the judgment of the pupils themselves, we shall at\r\n",
      "once teach them the habit of re-judging flattery, and substitute, by\r\n",
      "insensible degrees, patient, steady confidence in themselves, for the\r\n",
      "wavering, weak, impatience of vanity. In proportion as any one's\r\n",
      "confidence in himself increases, his anxiety for the applause of\r\n",
      "others diminishes: people are very seldom vain of any accomplishments\r\n",
      "in which they obviously excel, but they frequently continue to be vain\r\n",
      "of those which are doubtful. Where mankind have not confirmed their\r\n",
      "own judgment, they are restless, and continually aim either at\r\n",
      "convincing others, or themselves, that they are in the right. Hogarth,\r\n",

      "mankind, was not vain of this talent, but was extremely vain of his\r\n",

      "acknowledged literary talents, are seldom fond of amateurs; but, if\r\n",
      "they are but half satisfied of their own superiority, they collect the\r\n",
      "tribute of applause with avidity, and without discrimination or\r\n",
      "delicacy. Voltaire has been reproached with treating strangers rudely\r\n",

      "them with too large a portion of praise; _the smallest quantity of\r\n",
      "stimulus that can produce the exertion we desire, should be used_; if\r\n",
      "we use more, we waste our power, and injure our pupil. As soon as\r\n",
      "habit has made any exertion familiar, and consequently easy, we may\r\n",
      "withdraw the original excitation, and the exertion will still\r\n",
      "continue. In learning, for instance, a new language, at first, whilst\r\n",
      "the pupil is in the midst of the difficulties of regular and irregular\r\n",
      "verbs, and when, in translation, a dictionary is wanted at every\r\n",
      "moment, the occupation itself cannot be very agreeable; but we are\r\n",
      "excited by the hope that our labour will every day diminish, and that\r\n",
      "we shall at last enjoy the entertainment of reading useful and\r\n",
      "agreeable books. Children, who have not learnt by experience the\r\n",
      "pleasures of literature, cannot feel this hope as strongly as we do,\r\n",
      "we, therefore, excite them by praise; but by degrees they begin to\r\n",
      "feel the pleasure of success and occupation; when these are felt, we\r\n",
      "may and ought to withdraw the unnecessary excitements of praise. If we\r\n",
      "continue, we mislead the child's mind, and, whilst we deprive him of\r\n",
      "his natural reward, we give him a factitious taste. When any moral\r\n",
      "habit is to be acquired, or when we wish that our pupil should cure\r\n",
      "himself of any fault, we must employ at first strong excitement, and\r\n",
      "reward with warmth and eloquence of approbation; when the fault is\r\n",
      "conquered, when the virtue is acquired, the extraordinary excitement\r\n",
      "should be withdrawn, and all this should not be done with an air of\r\n",
      "mystery and artifice; the child should know all that we do, and why\r\n",
      "we do it; the sooner he learns how his own mind is managed, the\r\n",
      "better--the sooner he will assist in his own education.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Every body must have observed, that languor of mind succeeds to the\r\n",
      "intoxication of vanity; if we can avoid the intoxication, we shall\r\n",
      "avoid the languor. Common sayings often imply those sensible\r\n",
      "observations which philosophers, when they theorize only, express in\r\n",
      "other words. We frequently hear it said to a child, \"Praise spoils\r\n",
      "you; my praise did you harm; you can't bear praise well; you grow\r\n",
      "conceited; you become idle; you are good for nothing, because you have\r\n",
      "been too much flattered.\" All these expressions show, that the\r\n",
      "consequences of over-stimulating the mind by praise, have been vaguely\r\n",
      "taken notice of in education; but no general rules have been deduced\r\n",
      "from these observations. With children of different habits and\r\n",
      "temperaments, the same degree of excitement acts differently, so that\r\n",
      "it is scarcely possible to fix upon any positive quantity fit for all\r\n",
      "dispositions--the quantity must be relative; but we may, perhaps, fix\r\n",
      "upon a criterion by which, in most cases, the proportion may be\r\n",
      "ascertained. The golden rule,[95] which an eminent physician has given\r\n",
      "to the medical world for ascertaining the necessary and useful\r\n",
      "quantity of stimulus for weak and feverish patients, may, with\r\n",
      "advantage, be applied in education. Whenever praise produces the\r\n",
      "intoxication of vanity, it is hurtful; whenever the appearances of\r\n",
      "vanity diminish in consequence of praise, we may be satisfied that it\r\n",
      "does good, that it increases the pupil's confidence in himself, and\r\n",
      "his strength of mind. We repeat, that persons who have confidence in\r\n",
      "themselves, may be proud, but are never vain; that vanity cannot\r\n",
      "support herself without the concurring flattery of others; pride is\r\n",
      "satisfied with his own approbation. In the education of children who\r\n",
      "are more inclined to pride than to vanity, we must present large\r\n",
      "objects to the understanding, and large motives must be used to excite\r\n",
      "voluntary exertion. If the understanding of proud people be not early\r\n",
      "cultivated, they frequently fix upon some false ideas of honour or\r\n",
      "dignity, to which they are resolute martyrs through life. Thus the\r\n",
      "high-born Spaniards, if we may be allowed to reason from the imperfect\r\n",
      "history of national character. The Spaniards, who associate the ideas\r\n",
      "of dignity and indolence, would rather submit to the evils of poverty,\r\n",
      "than to the imaginary disgrace of working for their bread. Volney, and\r\n",
      "the baron de Tott, give us some curious instances of the pride of the\r\n",
      "Turks, which prevents them from being taught any useful arts by\r\n",
      "foreigners. To show how early false associations are formed and\r\n",
      "supported by pride, we need but recollect the anecdote of the child\r\n",
      "mentioned by de Tott.[96] The baron de Tott bought a pretty toy for a\r\n",
      "present for a little Turkish friend, but the child was too proud to\r\n",
      "seem pleased with the toy; the child's grandfather came into the room,\r\n",
      "saw, and was delighted with the toy, sat down on the carpet, and\r\n",
      "played with it until he broke it. We like the second childhood of the\r\n",
      "grandfather better than the premature old age of the grandson.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The self-command which the fear of disgrace insures, can produce\r\n",
      "either great virtues, or great vices. Revenge and generosity are, it\r\n",
      "is said, to be found in their highest state amongst nations and\r\n",
      "individuals characterized by pride. The early objects which are\r\n",
      "associated with the idea of honour in the mind, are of great\r\n",
      "consequence; but it is of yet more consequence to teach proud minds\r\n",
      "early to bend to the power of reason, or rather to glory in being\r\n",
      "governed by reason. They should be instructed, that the only possible\r\n",
      "means of maintaining their opinions amongst persons of sense, is to\r\n",
      "support them by unanswerable arguments. They should be taught, that,\r\n",
      "to secure respect, they must deserve it; and their self-denial, or\r\n",
      "self-command, should never obtain that tacit admiration which they\r\n",
      "most value, except where it is exerted for useful and rational\r\n",
      "purposes. The constant custom of appealing, in the last resort, to\r\n",
      "their own judgment, which distinguishes the proud from the vain, makes\r\n",
      "it peculiarly necessary that the judgment, to which so much is\r\n",
      "trusted, should be highly cultivated. A vain man may be tolerably well\r\n",
      "conducted in life by a sensible friend; a proud man ought to be able\r\n",
      "to conduct himself perfectly well, because he will not accept of any\r\n",
      "assistance. It seems that some proud people confine their benevolent\r\n",
      "virtues within a smaller sphere than others; they value only their own\r\n",
      "relations, their friends, their country, or whatever is connected with\r\n",
      "themselves. This species of pride may be corrected by the same means\r\n",
      "which are used to increase sympathy.[97] Those who, either from\r\n",
      "temperament, example, or accidental circumstances, have acquired the\r\n",
      "habit of repressing and commanding their emotions, must be carefully\r\n",
      "distinguished from the selfish and insensible. In the present times,\r\n",
      "when the affectation of sensibility is to be dreaded, we should rather\r\n",
      "encourage that species of pride which disdains to display the\r\n",
      "affections of the heart. \"You Romans triumph over your tears, and call\r\n",
      "it virtue! I triumph in my tears,\" says Caractacus; his tears were\r\n",
      "respectable, but in general the Roman triumph would command the most\r\n",
      "sympathy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some people attribute to pride all expressions of confidence in one's\r\n",
      "self: these may be offensive to common society, but they are sometimes\r\n",
      "powerful over the human mind, and where they are genuine, mark\r\n",
      "somewhat superior in character. Much of the effect of lord Chatham's\r\n",
      "eloquence, much of his transcendent influence in public, must be\r\n",
      "attributed to the confidence which he showed in his own superiority.\r\n",
      "\"I trample upon impossibilities!\" was an exclamation which no\r\n",
      "inferiour mind would dare to make. Would the house of commons have\r\n",
      "permitted any one but lord Chatham to have answered an oration by\r\n",
      "\"Tell me, gentle shepherd, where?\" The danger of failing, the hazard\r\n",
      "that he runs of becoming ridiculous who verges upon the moral sublime,\r\n",
      "is taken into our account when we judge of the action, and we pay\r\n",
      "involuntary tribute to courage and success: but how miserable is the\r\n",
      "fate of the man who mistakes his own powers, and upon trial is unable\r\n",
      "to support his assumed superiority; mankind revenge themselves without\r\n",
      "mercy upon his ridiculous pride, eager to teach him the difference\r\n",
      "between insolence and magnanimity. Young people inclined to over-rate\r\n",
      "their own talents, or to under-value the abilities of others, should\r\n",
      "frequently have instances given to them from real life, of the\r\n",
      "mortifications and disgrace to which imprudent boasters expose\r\n",
      "themselves. Where they are able to demonstrate their own abilities,\r\n",
      "they run no risk in speaking with decent confidence; but where their\r\n",
      "success depends, in any degree, either upon fortune or opinion, they\r\n",

      "mankind in favour of its possessor, and has the advantage of being\r\n",
      "both graceful and safe: this was perfectly understood by the crafty\r\n",
      "Ulysses, who neither raised his eyes, nor stretched his sceptered\r\n",
      "hand, \"when he first rose to speak.\" We do not, however, recommend\r\n",
      "this artificial modesty; its trick is soon discovered, and its\r\n",
      "sameness of dissimulation presently disgusts. Prudence should prevent\r\n",
      "young people from hazardous boasting; and good nature and good sense,\r\n",
      "which constitute real politeness, will restrain them from obtruding\r\n",
      "their merits to the mortification of their companions: but we do not\r\n",
      "expect from them total ignorance of their own comparative merit. The\r\n",
      "affectation of humility, when carried to the extreme, to which all\r\n",
      "affectation is liable to be carried, appears full as ridiculous as\r\n",
      "troublesome, and offensive as any of the graces of vanity, or the airs\r\n",
      "of pride. Young people are cured of presumption by mixing with\r\n",
      "society, but they are not so easily cured of any species of\r\n",
      "affectation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the chapter on female accomplishments, we have endeavoured to point\r\n",
      "out, that the enlargement of understanding in the fair sex, which must\r\n",

      "necessarily subjected. See also Mirabeau's \"Secret History of the\r\n",
      "Court of Berlin,\" for a picture of a man of great abilities degraded\r\n",
      "by the same species of low unprincipled competition. We may find in\r\n",
      "these books, it is to be hoped, examples which will strike young and\r\n",
      "generous minds, and which may inspire them with contempt for the\r\n",

      "happiness of his fellow creatures; he feels the want of power to carry\r\n",
      "these into effect; power becomes the object of his wishes. In the\r\n",

      "attainment of political power. The moment when a minister takes\r\n",
      "possession of his place, surrounded by crowds and congratulations, is\r\n",
      "well described; and the succeeding moment, when clerks with immense\r\n",
      "portfolios enter, is a striking contrast. Examples from romance can\r\n",
      "never have such a powerful effect upon the mind, as those which are\r\n",
      "taken from real life; but in proportion to the just and lively\r\n",
      "representation of situations, and passions resembling reality,\r\n",
      "fictions may convey useful moral lessons. In the Cyropædia there is an\r\n",
      "admirable description of the day spent by the victorious Cyrus, giving\r\n",

      "upon the minds of the ambitious. This may arise from two causes; from\r\n",
      "the reasoning faculty's not having been sufficiently cultivated, or\r\n",
      "from the habits of ambition being formed before proper examples are\r\n",
      "presented to the judgment for comparison. Some ambitious people, when\r\n",
      "they reason coolly, acknowledge and feel the folly of their pursuits;\r\n",
      "but still, from the force of habit, they act immediately in obedience\r\n",
      "to the motives which they condemn: others, who have never been\r\n",
      "accustomed to reason firmly, believe themselves to be in the right in\r\n",
      "the choice of their objects; and they cannot comprehend the arguments\r\n",
      "which are used by those who have not the same way of thinking as\r\n",
      "themselves. If we fairly place facts before young people, who have\r\n",
      "been habituated to reason, and who have not yet been inspired with the\r\n",
      "passion, or enslaved by the habits of vulgar ambition, it is probable,\r\n",

      "sedulously be kept from contagion. No books should be put into the\r\n",
      "hands of this happy class of children, but such as present the best\r\n",
      "models of virtue: there is no occasion to shock them with caricatures\r\n",

      "who speaks correctly, a book exhibiting instances of vice, should\r\n",
      "never be given to a child who thinks and acts correctly. The love of\r\n",

      "Without the habit of reasoning, the best dispositions can give us no\r\n",
      "solid security for happiness; therefore, we should early cultivate the\r\n",
      "reasoning faculty, instead of always appealing to the imagination. By\r\n",
      "sentimental persuasives, a child may be successfully governed for a\r\n",

      "The boy sees that many people are richer than his father, and\r\n",
      "perceiving that their riches procure a great number of conveniences\r\n",

      "is not sufficiently accurate for a child; it would confound his ideas\r\n",
      "of property, and it would be immediately contradicted by his\r\n",
      "experience. The father's reasoning is perfectly good, and well adapted\r\n",
      "to his pupil's capacity, when he asks, \"whether he should not require\r\n",

      "property. Here is a direct contradiction; for a few minutes before he\r\n",
      "had asserted that they belonged to him. Property is often the cause of\r\n",
      "much anxiety to its possessor; but the question is, whether the pains,\r\n",
      "or the pleasures of possessing it, predominate; if this question could\r\n",
      "not be fully discussed, it should not be partially stated. To silence\r\n",
      "a child in argument is easy, to convince him is difficult; sophistry\r\n",

      "of authority; they will not obey the dictates of interest; they\r\n",
      "secretly despise the anathemas of sentiment. Esteem and affection, are\r\n",
      "the necessary consequences of a certain course of conduct, combined\r\n",

      "Will it be thought to proceed from a spirit of contradiction, if we\r\n",

      "absolutely incompatible with the sober perseverance necessary to\r\n",
      "success in any other liberal professions. To girls, this species of\r\n",

      "of adventures; and where there appears an obvious impossibility in\r\n",
      "gratifying any wish, it is not likely to become, or at least to\r\n",
      "continue, a torment to the imagination. Boys, on the contrary, from\r\n",
      "the habits of their education, are prone to admire, and to imitate,\r\n",
      "every thing like enterprise and heroism. Courage and fortitude, are\r\n",
      "the virtues of men, and it is natural that boys should desire, if they\r\n",

      "and extraordinary situations which can display them to advantage. The\r\n",
      "taste for adventure, is not repressed in boys by the impossibility of\r\n",
      "its indulgence; the world is before them, and they think that fame\r\n",
      "promises the highest prize to those who will most boldly venture in\r\n",
      "the lottery of fortune. The rational probability of success, few young\r\n",
      "people are able, fewer still are willing, to calculate; and the\r\n",

      "takes it for granted that he is a favourite, and that it will be\r\n",
      "bestowed upon him. The profits of commerce and of agriculture, the\r\n",
      "profits of every art and profession, can be estimated with tolerable\r\n",
      "accuracy; the value of activity, application and abilities, can be\r\n",
      "respectively measured by some certain standard. Modest, or even\r\n",
      "prudent people, will scruple to rate themselves in all of these\r\n",
      "qualifications superior to their neighbours; but every man will allow\r\n",

      "formidable light, compared with the alluring prospects presented by an\r\n",
      "adventuring imagination. At this time of life, it will be too late\r\n",
      "suddenly to change the taste; it will be inconvenient, if not\r\n",

      "old, longs to be Robinson Crusoe, or Sinbad the sailor, may at\r\n",
      "seventeen, retain the same taste for adventure and enterprise, though\r\n",
      "mixed so as to be less discernible, with the incipient passions of\r\n",
      "avarice and ambition; he has the same dispositions modified by a\r\n",
      "slight knowledge of real life, and guided by the manners and\r\n",
      "conversation of his friends and acquaintance. Robinson Crusoe and\r\n",
      "Sinbad, will no longer be his favourite heroes; but he will now admire\r\n",
      "the soldier of fortune, the commercial adventurer, or the nabob, who\r\n",

      "reasons why it is dangerous to pamper the taste early with mere books\r\n",
      "of entertainment; to voyages and travels, we have made some\r\n",
      "objections. Natural history, is a study particularly suited to\r\n",
      "children: it cultivates their talents for observation, applies to\r\n",

      "avoid tedious, unnecessary detail. We shall, however, just observe,\r\n",
      "that the lessons on natural history, on metals, and on chemistry, are\r\n",
      "particularly useful, not so much from the quantity of knowledge which,\r\n",
      "they contain, as by the agreeable manner in which it is communicated:\r\n",
      "the mind is opened to extensive views, at the same time that nothing\r\n",
      "above the comprehension of children is introduced. The mixture of\r\n",

      "thought a necessary accomplishment in one sex, and an essential part\r\n",

      "which teaches by the experience of the past, what we may expect in\r\n",
      "future. To study history as it relates to these objects, the pupil\r\n",
      "must have acquired much previous knowledge; the habit of reasoning,\r\n",
      "and the power of combining distant analogies. The works of Hume, of\r\n",

      "nonsense: they have very little motive for the study of history, and\r\n",
      "all that we can say to keep alive their interest, amounts to the\r\n",

      "afterwards be ready for service at our summons. One allusion may be\r\n",
      "fairly answered by another, since it is impossible to oppose allusion\r\n",
      "by reasoning. In accumulating facts, as in amassing riches, people\r\n",
      "often begin by believing that they value wealth only for the use they\r\n",
      "shall make of it; but it often happens, that during the course of\r\n",
      "their labours, they learn habitually to set a value upon the coin\r\n",
      "itself, and they grow avaricious of that which they are sensible has\r\n",

      "make some good use of their treasure; but they frequently forget their\r\n",

      "knowledge; it is essential to arrange facts so that they shall be\r\n",

      "select and combine. The power of retentive memory is exercised too\r\n",
      "much, the faculty of recollective memory is exercised too little, by\r\n",
      "the common modes of education. Whilst children are reading the history\r\n",
      "of kings, and battles, and victories; whilst they are learning tables\r\n",
      "of chronology and lessons of geography by rote, their inventive and\r\n",
      "their reasoning faculties are absolutely passive; nor are any of the\r\n",
      "facts which they learn in this manner, associated with circumstances\r\n",
      "in real life. These trains of ideas may with much pains and labour be\r\n",
      "fixed in the memory, but they must be recalled precisely in the order\r\n",
      "in which they were learnt by rote, and this is not the order in which\r\n",
      "they may be wanted: they will be conjured up in technical succession,\r\n",
      "or in troublesome multitudes.--Many people are obliged to repeat the\r\n",
      "alphabet before they can recollect the relative place of any given\r\n",
      "letter; others repeat a column of the multiplication table before they\r\n",
      "can recollect the given sum of the number they want. There is a common\r\n",
      "rigmarole for telling the number of days in each month in the year;\r\n",
      "those who have learnt it by heart, usually repeat the whole of it\r\n",
      "before they can recollect the place of the month which they want; and\r\n",
      "sometimes in running over the lines, people miss the very month which\r\n",
      "they are thinking of, or repeat its name without perceiving that they\r\n",
      "have named it. In the same manner, those who have learned historical\r\n",
      "or chronological facts in a technical mode, must go through the whole\r\n",
      "train of their rigmarole associations before they can hit upon the\r\n",
      "idea which they want. Lord Bolingbroke mentions an acquaintance of\r\n",
      "his, who had an amazing collection of facts in his memory, but\r\n",
      "unfortunately he could never produce one of them in the proper moment;\r\n",
      "he was always obliged to go back to to some fixed landing place, from\r\n",
      "which he was accustomed to take his flight. Lord Bolingbroke used to\r\n",
      "be afraid of asking him a question, because when once he began, he\r\n",
      "went off like a larum, and could not be stopped; he poured out a\r\n",
      "profusion of things which had nothing to do with the point in\r\n",
      "question; and it was ten to one but he omitted the only circumstance\r\n",
      "that would have been really serviceable. Many people who have\r\n",
      "tenacious memories, and who have been ill educated, find themselves in\r\n",
      "a similar condition, with much knowledge baled up, an incumbrance to\r\n",
      "themselves and to their friends. The great difference which appears in\r\n",
      "men of the same profession, and in the same circumstances, depends\r\n",
      "upon the application of their knowledge more than upon the quantity of\r\n",
      "their learning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With respect to a knowledge of history and chronologic learning, every\r\n",
      "body is now nearly upon a level; this species of information cannot be\r\n",
      "a great distinction to any one; a display of such common knowledge, is\r\n",
      "considered by literary people, and by men of genius especially, as\r\n",
      "ridiculous and offensive. One motive, therefore, for loading the minds\r\n",
      "of children with historic dates and facts, is likely, even from its\r\n",
      "having universally operated, to cease to operate in future. Without\r\n",
      "making it a laborious task to young people, it is easy to give them\r\n",
      "such a knowledge of history, as will preserve them from the shame of\r\n",

      "the purpose of shining in conversation. For our purpose, it is not\r\n",
      "necessary early to study voluminous philosophic histories; these\r\n",
      "should be preserved for a more advanced period of their education. The\r\n",
      "first thing to be done, is to seize the moment when curiosity is\r\n",
      "excited by the accidental mention of any historic name or event. When\r\n",
      "a child hears his father talk of the Roman emperors, or of the Roman\r\n",
      "people, he naturally inquires who these people were; some short\r\n",
      "explanation may be given, so as to leave curiosity yet unsatisfied.\r\n",
      "The prints of the Roman emperors' heads, and Mrs. Trimmer's prints of\r\n",
      "the remarkable events in the Roman and English history, will entertain\r\n",
      "children. Madame de Silleri, in her Adela and Theodore, describes\r\n",
      "historical hangings, which she found advantageous to her pupils. In a\r\n",
      "prince's palace, or a nobleman's palace, such hangings would be\r\n",
      "suitable decorations, or in a public seminary of education it would be\r\n",
      "worth while to prepare them: private families would, perhaps, be\r\n",
      "alarmed at the idea of expense, and at the idea, that their house\r\n",
      "could not readily be furnished in proper time for the instruction of\r\n",
      "children. As we know the effect of such apprehensions of difficulty,\r\n",
      "we forbear from insisting upon historical hangings, especially as we\r\n",
      "think that children should not, by any great apparatus for teaching\r\n",
      "them history, be induced to set an exorbitant value upon this sort of\r\n",
      "knowledge, and should hence be excited to cultivate their memories\r\n",
      "without reasoning or reflecting. If any expedients are thought\r\n",
      "necessary to fix historic facts early in the mind, the entertaining\r\n",
      "display of Roman emperors, and British kings and queens, may be made,\r\n",
      "as madame de Silleri recommends, in a magic lantern, or by the Ombres\r\n",
      "Chinoises. When these are exhibited, there should be some care taken\r\n",
      "not to introduce any false ideas. Parents should be present at the\r\n",
      "spectacle, and should answer each eager question with prudence. \"Ha!\r\n",
      "here comes queen Elizabeth!\" exclaims the child; \"was she a good\r\n",
      "woman?\" A foolish show-man would answer, \"Yes, master, she was the\r\n",
      "greatest queen that ever sat upon the English throne!\" A sensible\r\n",
      "mother would reply, \"My dear, I cannot answer that question; you will\r\n",
      "read her history yourself, you will judge by her actions, whether she\r\n",
      "was, or was not, a good woman.\" Children are often extremely impatient\r\n",
      "to settle the precise merit and demerit of every historical personage,\r\n",
      "with whose names they become acquainted; but this impatience should\r\n",
      "not be gratified by the short method of referring to the characters\r\n",
      "given of these persons in any common historical abridgment. We should\r\n",
      "advise all such characters to be omitted in books for children; let\r\n",
      "those who read, form a judgment for themselves: this will do more\r\n",
      "service to the understanding, than can be done by learning by rote the\r\n",
      "opinion of any historian. The good and bad qualities; the decisive,\r\n",

      "easy explanations of political events, which are meant to be suited\r\n",
      "to _the meanest capacities_. These reflections and explanations do\r\n",
      "much harm; they instil prejudice, and they accustom the young\r\n",
      "unsuspicious reader to swallow absurd reasoning, merely because it is\r\n",
      "often presented to him. If no history can be found entirely free from\r\n",
      "these defects, and if it be even impossible to correct any completely,\r\n",
      "without writing the whole over again, yet much may be done by those\r\n",
      "who hear children read. Explanations can be given at the moment when\r\n",

      "with in books, with freedom, and that minute accuracy which is only\r\n",
      "tiresome to those who cannot reason. The simple morality of childhood\r\n",

      "imagination, &c.--he adds, that he thought it useless to give to the\r\n",
      "public the conversations and explanations which he had with his pupil\r\n",
      "on these subjects. Both parents and children must regret the\r\n",
      "suppression of these explanatory notes; as the lessons appear at\r\n",
      "present, no child of seven years old can understand, and few\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"The idea, for instance, which I have of Peter, is singular, or\r\n",

      "exercised upon abstract ideas; for this objection M. Condillac has\r\n",
      "afterwards a provisional clause, but the original definition remains\r\n",
      "defective, because the direction of the organs is not, though it be\r\n",
      "stated as such, essential: besides, we are told only, that the\r\n",
      "sensation described becomes (devient) what we call attention. What\r\n",

      "of pain or pleasure, in the form of what we call reward and\r\n",
      "punishment, may probably be early perceived. Children will be\r\n",

      "the production of his ideas; he saw the origin and the progress of the\r\n",
      "habits which he had contracted, and he perceived how he could\r\n",
      "substitute just ideas for the false ones which had been given to him,\r\n",

      "The perusal of the best authors in the English language, will give\r\n",

      "it is too diffuse.--Hume, Blackstone, and Smith, have a proper degree\r\n",
      "of strength and energy combined with their elegance. Gibbon says, that\r\n",
      "the perfect composition and well turned periods of Dr. Robertson,\r\n",
      "excited his hopes, that he might one day become his equal in writing;\r\n",
      "but \"the calm philosophy, the careless inimitable beauties of his\r\n",
      "friend and rival Hume, often forced him to close the volume with a\r\n",

      "judge, that a simple style appears to the best judges to be more\r\n",
      "difficult to attain, and more desirable, than that highly ornamented\r\n",
      "diction to which writers of inferior taste aspire. Gibbon tells us,\r\n",
      "with great candour, that his friend Hume advised him to beware of the\r\n",
      "rhetorical style of French eloquence. Hume observed, that the English\r\n",

      "the taste of young readers; what they admire when they read, they will\r\n",
      "probably imitate when they write. We objected to works of criticism\r\n",
      "for young children, but we should observe, that at a later period of\r\n",
      "education, they will be found highly advantageous. It would be absurd\r\n",
      "to mark the precise age at which Blair's Lectures, or Condillac's Art\r\n",
      "d'Ecrire, ought to be read, because this should be decided by\r\n",
      "circumstances; by the progress of the pupils in literature, and by the\r\n",
      "subjects to which their attention happens to have turned. Of these,\r\n",
      "preceptors, and the pupils themselves, must be the most competent\r\n",
      "judges. From the same wish to avoid all pedantic attempts to dictate,\r\n",
      "we have not given any regular course of study in this chapter. Many\r\n",
      "able writers have laid down extensive plans of study, and have named\r\n",
      "the books that are essential to the acquisition of different branches\r\n",
      "of knowledge. Amongst others we may refer to Dr. Priestley's, which is\r\n",
      "to be seen at the end of his Essays on Education. We are sensible that\r\n",
      "order is necessary in reading, but we cannot think that the same order\r\n",
      "will suit all minds, nor do we imagine that a young person cannot\r\n",

      "essential service in improving the art of education. We might then\r\n",
      "mark the progress of the understanding with accuracy, and discover,\r\n",
      "with some degree of certainty, the circumstances on which the\r\n",
      "formation of the character and taste depend. Swift has given us a list\r\n",
      "of the books which he read during two years of his life; we can trace\r\n",
      "the ideas that he acquired from them in his Laputa, and other parts of\r\n",
      "Gulliver's travels. Gibbon's journal of his studies, and his account\r\n",
      "of universities, are very instructive to young students. So is the\r\n",
      "life of Franklin, written by himself. Madame Roland has left a history\r\n",
      "of her education; and in the books she read in her early years, we see\r\n",
      "the formation of her character. Plutarch's Lives, she tells us, first\r\n",
      "kindled republican enthusiasm in her mind; and she regrets that, in\r\n",
      "forming her ideas of universal liberty, she had only a partial view of\r\n",
      "affairs. She corrected these enthusiastic ideas during the last\r\n",
      "moments of her life in prison. Had the impression which her study of\r\n",
      "the Roman history made upon her mind been known to an able preceptor,\r\n",
      "it might have been corrected in her early education. When she was led\r\n",
      "to execution, she exclaimed, as she passed the statue of Liberty, \"Oh\r\n",
      "Liberty, what crimes are committed in thy name!\"[126]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Formerly it was wisely said, \"Tell me what company a man keeps, and I\r\n",

Picture: Getty ImagesSource:SuppliedA MAJOR crackdown on MS-13 in the US has confirmed the violent drug gang’s tentacles have infiltrated Australia.New York’s Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas announced 17 alleged members and associates of MS-13, also known as Mara Salvatrucha, have been indicted by a grand jury in the US on murder, conspiracy to commit murder and drug trafficking charges.The gang is made up of machete-wielding “cliques”, with members reporting back to leaders in the central American nation of El Salvador.A grand jury has indicted alleged members of the notoriously violent MS-13 gang on a slew of charges including murder and drug trafficking. Picture: APSource:APThe investigation began in May, 2017, and US authorities were surprised to discover the gang’s international reach.“We uncovered a structured network of MS-13 operations in New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Texas, from within a Mississippi prison cell, and in countries around the globe including Mexico, Colombia, Korea, France, Australia, Peru, Egypt, Ecuador and Cuba,” Ms Singas said.The probe found MS-13 members in Mexico, Colombia, Korea, France, Australia, Peru, Egypt, Ecuador and Cuba. Picture: APSource:APMs Singas said she believes MS-13 members were in the countries she listed.“We were surprised to see some of those countries,” she said.“The investigation definitely revealed MS-13 has expanded its reach internationally.”Suspected members of the MS-13 gang are escorted to their arraignment in New York.

The teenager’s body was allegedly mutilated with a weapon consistent with a machete “and cement was poured over his body”.\\n\\nThe investigation also led to the arrest in El Salvador of a MS-13 kingpin charged with 17 horrific murders.Soldiers during a campaign to clean up graffiti associated with the Mara Salvatrucha gang in Quezaltepeque, a town 15km from San Salvador. Picture: AFPSource:AFP“It is no secret that the MS-13’s motto is kill, rape, and control,” Angel Melendez, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in New York, said.“When you look at the charges against these individuals today, it shows that they stay true to their ruthless ways, and will fund their gang activities by any means.”\\n\\ntrending in world97\\n\\nSergei Skripal: UK spy poisoning raises security concerns23\\n\\nPyongyang makes 'agreement' with S.Korea24\\n\\nISIS vs. US: Video of Niger ambush shows deadly battle\\n\\nShare on FacebookShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare via EmailJump back to top\\n \\nMORE IN worldToddlers get ‘laced’ gummy bears at day care19yo arrested for ‘free sex’ offerThis is how easy it is to poison a spyFather’s cruel punishment for ‘bully’ sonPhoto police didn’t want to releaseWhy James Bulger’s killer doesn’t want freedom‘New era’: America’s scary stealth fighterChina’s huge military expansion\\n\\nFOLLOW USADVERTISEABOUT USNEWSLETTERSCONNECTBe rewardedfor your opinions\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLegal:Privacy PolicyRelevant Ads Opt-OutCookie PolicyTerms & ConditionsA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

       "'[The Man Who Was Thursday by G. K. Chesterton 1908]\\n\\nTo Edmund Clerihew Bentley\\n\\nA cloud was on the mind of men, and wailing went the weather,\\nYea, a sick cloud upon the soul when we were boys together.\\nScience announced nonentity and art admired decay;\\nThe world was old and ended: but you and I were gay;\\nRound us in antic order their crippled vices came--\\nLust that had lost its laughter, fear that had lost its shame.\\nLike the white lock of Whistler, that lit our aimless gloom,\\nMen showed their own white feather as proudly as a plume.\\nLife was a fly that faded, and death a drone that stung;\\nThe world was very old indeed when you and I were young.\\nThey twisted even decent sin to shapes not to be named:\\nMen were ashamed of honour; but we were not ashamed.\\nWeak if we were and foolish, not thus we failed, not thus;\\nWhen that black Baal blocked the heavens he had no hymns from us\\nChildren we were--our forts of sand were even as weak as eve,\\nHigh as they went we piled them up to break that bitter sea.\\nFools as we were in motley, all jangling and absurd,\\nWhen all church bells were silent our cap and beds were heard.\\n\\nNot all unhelped we held the fort, our tiny flags unfurled;\\nSome giants laboured in that cloud to lift it from the world.\\nI find again the book we found, I feel the hour that flings\\nFar out of fish-shaped Paumanok some cry of cleaner things;\\nAnd the Green Carnation withered, as in forest fires that pass,\\nRoared in the wind of all the world ten million leaves of grass;\\nOr sane and sweet and sudden as a bird sings in the rain--\\nTruth out of Tusitala spoke and pleasure out of pain.\\nYea, cool and clear and sudden as a bird sings in the grey,\\nDunedin to Samoa spoke, and darkness unto day.\\nBut we were young; we lived to see God break their bitter charms.\\nGod and the good Republic come riding back in arms:\\nWe have seen the City of Mansoul, even as it rocked, relieved--\\nBlessed are they who did not see, but being blind, believed.\\n\\nThis is a tale of those old fears, even of those emptied hells,\\nAnd none but you shall understand the true thing that it tells--\\nOf what colossal gods of shame could cow men and yet crash,\\nOf what huge devils hid the stars, yet fell at a pistol flash.\\nThe doubts that were so plain to chase, so dreadful to withstand--\\nOh, who shall understand but you; yea, who shall understand?\\nThe doubts that drove us through the night as we two talked amain,\\nAnd day had broken on the streets e\\'er it broke upon the brain.\\nBetween us, by the peace of God, such truth can now be told;\\nYea, there is strength in striking root and good in growing old.\\nWe have found common things at last and marriage and a creed,\\nAnd I may safely write it now, and you may safely read.\\n\\nG. K. C.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nTHE TWO POETS OF SAFFRON PARK\\n\\nTHE suburb of Saffron Park lay on the sunset side of London, as\\nred and ragged as a cloud of sunset. It was built of a bright\\nbrick throughout; its sky-line was fantastic, and even its ground\\nplan was wild. It had been the outburst of a speculative builder,\\nfaintly tinged with art, who called its architecture sometimes\\nElizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne, apparently under the\\nimpression that the two sovereigns were identical. It was described\\nwith some justice as an artistic colony, though it never in any\\ndefinable way produced any art. But although its pretensions to be\\nan intellectual centre were a little vague, its pretensions to be a\\npleasant place were quite indisputable. The stranger who looked for\\nthe first time at the quaint red houses could only think how very\\noddly shaped the people must be who could fit in to them. Nor when\\nhe met the people was he disappointed in this respect. The place\\nwas not only pleasant, but perfect, if once he could regard it not\\nas a deception but rather as a dream. Even if the people were not\\n\"artists,\" the whole was nevertheless artistic. That young man with\\nthe long, auburn hair and the impudent face--that young man was not\\nreally a poet; but surely he was a poem. That old gentleman with\\nthe wild, white beard and the wild, white hat--that venerable\\nhumbug was not really a philosopher; but at least he was the cause\\nof philosophy in others. That scientific gentleman with the bald,\\negg-like head and the bare, bird-like neck had no real right to the\\nairs of science that he assumed. He had not discovered anything new\\nin biology; but what biological creature could he have discovered\\nmore singular than himself? Thus, and thus only, the whole place\\nhad properly to be regarded; it had to be considered not so much\\nas a workshop for artists, but as a frail but finished work of art.\\nA man who stepped into its social atmosphere felt as if he had\\nstepped into a written comedy.\\n\\nMore especially this attractive unreality fell upon it about\\nnightfall, when the extravagant roofs were dark against the\\nafterglow and the whole insane village seemed as separate as a\\ndrifting cloud. This again was more strongly true of the many\\nnights of local festivity, when the little gardens were often\\nilluminated, and the big Chinese lanterns glowed in the dwarfish\\ntrees like some fierce and monstrous fruit. And this was strongest\\nof all on one particular evening, still vaguely remembered in the\\nlocality, of which the auburn-haired poet was the hero. It was not\\nby any means the only evening of which he was the hero. On many\\nnights those passing by his little back garden might hear his high,\\ndidactic voice laying down the law to men and particularly to\\nwomen. The attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of the\\nparadoxes of the place. Most of the women were of the kind vaguely\\ncalled emancipated, and professed some protest against male\\nsupremacy. Yet these new women would always pay to a man the\\nextravagant compliment which no ordinary woman ever pays to him,\\nthat of listening while he is talking. And Mr. Lucian Gregory, the\\nred-haired poet, was really (in some sense) a man worth listening\\nto, even if one only laughed at the end of it. He put the old cant\\nof the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain\\nimpudent freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure. He was\\nhelped in some degree by the arresting oddity of his appearance,\\nwhich he worked, as the phrase goes, for all it was worth. His dark\\nred hair parted in the middle was literally like a woman\\'s, and\\ncurved into the slow curls of a virgin in a pre-Raphaelite picture.\\nFrom within this almost saintly oval, however, his face projected\\nsuddenly broad and brutal, the chin carried forward with a look of\\ncockney contempt. This combination at once tickled and terrified\\nthe nerves of a neurotic population. He seemed like a walking\\nblasphemy, a blend of the angel and the ape.\\n\\nThis particular evening, if it is remembered for nothing else,\\nwill be remembered in that place for its strange sunset. It looked\\nlike the end of the world. All the heaven seemed covered with a\\nquite vivid and palpable plumage; you could only say that the sky\\nwas full of feathers, and of feathers that almost brushed the\\nface. Across the great part of the dome they were grey, with the\\nstrangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or pale\\ngreen; but towards the west the whole grew past description,\\ntransparent and passionate, and the last red-hot plumes of it\\ncovered up the sun like something too good to be seen. The whole\\nwas so close about the earth, as to express nothing but a violent\\nsecrecy. The very empyrean seemed to be a secret. It expressed\\nthat splendid smallness which is the soul of local patriotism. The\\nvery sky seemed small.\\n\\nI say that there are some inhabitants who may remember the evening\\nif only by that oppressive sky. There are others who may remember\\nit because it marked the first appearance in the place of the\\nsecond poet of Saffron Park. For a long time the red-haired\\nrevolutionary had reigned without a rival; it was upon the night\\nof the sunset that his solitude suddenly ended. The new poet, who\\nintroduced himself by the name of Gabriel Syme was a very\\nmild-looking mortal, with a fair, pointed beard and faint, yellow\\nhair. But an impression grew that he was less meek than he looked.\\nHe signalised his entrance by differing with the established poet,\\nGregory, upon the whole nature of poetry. He said that he (Syme)\\nwas poet of law, a poet of order; nay, he said he was a poet of\\nrespectability. So all the Saffron Parkers looked at him as if he\\nhad that moment fallen out of that impossible sky.\\n\\nIn fact, Mr. Lucian Gregory, the anarchic poet, connected the two\\nevents.\\n\\n\"It may well be,\" he said, in his sudden lyrical manner, \"it may\\nwell be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is\\nbrought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet.\\nYou say you are a poet of law; I say you are a contradiction in\\nterms. I only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on the\\nnight you appeared in this garden.\"\\n\\nThe man with the meek blue eyes and the pale, pointed beard endured\\nthese thunders with a certain submissive solemnity. The third party\\nof the group, Gregory\\'s sister Rosamond, who had her brother\\'s\\nbraids of red hair, but a kindlier face underneath them, laughed\\nwith such mixture of admiration and disapproval as she gave\\ncommonly to the family oracle.\\n\\nGregory resumed in high oratorical good humour.\\n\\n\"An artist is identical with an anarchist,\" he cried. \"You might\\ntranspose the words anywhere. An anarchist is an artist. The man\\nwho throws a bomb is an artist, because he prefers a great moment\\nto everything. He sees how much more valuable is one burst of\\nblazing light, one peal of perfect thunder, than the mere common\\nbodies of a few shapeless policemen. An artist disregards all\\ngovernments, abolishes all conventions. The poet delights in\\ndisorder only. If it were not so, the most poetical thing in the\\nworld would be the Underground Railway.\"\\n\\n\"So it is,\" said Mr. Syme.\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" said Gregory, who was very rational when anyone else\\nattempted paradox. \"Why do all the clerks and navvies in the\\nrailway trains look so sad and tired, so very sad and tired? I will\\ntell you. It is because they know that the train is going right. It\\nis because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket\\nfor that place they will reach. It is because after they have\\npassed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be\\nVictoria, and nothing but Victoria. Oh, their wild rapture! oh,\\ntheir eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden, if the next\\nstation were unaccountably Baker Street!\"\\n\\n\"It is you who are unpoetical,\" replied the poet Syme. \"If what you\\nsay of clerks is true, they can only be as prosaic as your poetry.\\nThe rare, strange thing is to hit the mark; the gross, obvious\\nthing is to miss it. We feel it is epical when man with one wild\\narrow strikes a distant bird. Is it not also epical when man with\\none wild engine strikes a distant station? Chaos is dull; because\\nin chaos the train might indeed go anywhere, to Baker Street or to\\nBagdad. But man is a magician, and his whole magic is in this, that\\nhe does say Victoria, and lo! it is Victoria. No, take your books\\nof mere poetry and prose; let me read a time table, with tears of\\npride. Take your Byron, who commemorates the defeats of man; give\\nme Bradshaw, who commemorates his victories. Give me Bradshaw, I\\nsay!\"\\n\\n\"Must you go?\" inquired Gregory sarcastically.\\n\\n\"I tell you,\" went on Syme with passion, \"that every time a train\\ncomes in I feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers, and\\nthat man has won a battle against chaos. You say contemptuously\\nthat when one has left Sloane Square one must come to Victoria. I\\nsay that one might do a thousand things instead, and that whenever\\nI really come there I have the sense of hairbreadth escape. And\\nwhen I hear the guard shout out the word \\'Victoria,\\' it is not an\\nunmeaning word. It is to me the cry of a herald announcing\\nconquest. It is to me indeed \\'Victoria\\'; it is the victory of\\nAdam.\"\\n\\nGregory wagged his heavy, red head with a slow and sad smile.\\n\\n\"And even then,\" he said, \"we poets always ask the question, \\'And\\nwhat is Victoria now that you have got there ?\\' You think Victoria\\nis like the New Jerusalem. We know that the New Jerusalem will only\\nbe like Victoria. Yes, the poet will be discontented even in the\\nstreets of heaven. The poet is always in revolt.\"\\n\\n\"There again,\" said Syme irritably, \"what is there poetical about\\nbeing in revolt ? You might as well say that it is poetical to be\\nsea-sick. Being sick is a revolt. Both being sick and being\\nrebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate\\noccasions; but I\\'m hanged if I can see why they are poetical.\\nRevolt in the abstract is--revolting. It\\'s mere vomiting.\"\\n\\nThe girl winced for a flash at the unpleasant word, but Syme was\\ntoo hot to heed her.\\n\\n\"It is things going right,\" he cried, \"that is poetical I Our\\ndigestions, for instance, going sacredly and silently right, that\\nis the foundation of all poetry. Yes, the most poetical thing, more\\npoetical than the flowers, more poetical than the stars--the most\\npoetical thing in the world is not being sick.\"\\n\\n\"Really,\" said Gregory superciliously, \"the examples you choose--\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Syme grimly, \"I forgot we had abolished\\nall conventions.\"\\n\\nFor the first time a red patch appeared on Gregory\\'s forehead.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t expect me,\" he said, \"to revolutionise society on this\\nlawn ?\"\\n\\nSyme looked straight into his eyes and smiled sweetly.\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t,\" he said; \"but I suppose that if you were serious\\nabout your anarchism, that is exactly what you would do.\"\\n\\nGregory\\'s big bull\\'s eyes blinked suddenly like those of an angry\\nlion, and one could almost fancy that his red mane rose.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you think, then,\" he said in a dangerous voice, \"that I am\\nserious about my anarchism?\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon ?\" said Syme.\\n\\n\"Am I not serious about my anarchism ?\" cried Gregory, with knotted\\nfists.\\n\\n\"My dear fellow!\" said Syme, and strolled away.\\n\\nWith surprise, but with a curious pleasure, he found Rosamond\\nGregory still in his company.\\n\\n\"Mr. Syme,\" she said, \"do the people who talk like you and my\\nbrother often mean what they say ? Do you mean what you say now ?\"\\n\\nSyme smiled.\\n\\n\"Do you ?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"What do you mean ?\" asked the girl, with grave eyes.\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Gregory,\" said Syme gently, \"there are many kinds of\\nsincerity and insincerity. When you say \\'thank you\\' for the salt,\\ndo you mean what you say ? No. When you say \\'the world is round,\\'\\ndo you mean what you say ? No. It is true, but you don\\'t mean it.\\nNow, sometimes a man like your brother really finds a thing he does\\nmean. It may be only a half-truth, quarter-truth, tenth-truth; but\\nthen he says more than he means--from sheer force of meaning it.\"\\n\\nShe was looking at him from under level brows; her face was grave\\nand open, and there had fallen upon it the shadow of that\\nunreasoning responsibility which is at the bottom of the most\\nfrivolous woman, the maternal watch which is as old as the world.\\n\\n\"Is he really an anarchist, then?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Only in that sense I speak of,\" replied Syme; \"or if you prefer\\nit, in that nonsense.\"\\n\\nShe drew her broad brows together and said abruptly--\\n\\n\"He wouldn\\'t really use--bombs or that sort of thing?\"\\n\\nSyme broke into a great laugh, that seemed too large for his slight\\nand somewhat dandified figure.\\n\\n\"Good Lord, no!\" he said, \"that has to be done anonymously.\"\\n\\nAnd at that the corners of her own mouth broke into a smile, and\\nshe thought with a simultaneous pleasure of Gregory\\'s absurdity\\nand of his safety.\\n\\nSyme strolled with her to a seat in the corner of the garden, and\\ncontinued to pour out his opinions. For he was a sincere man, and\\nin spite of his superficial airs and graces, at root a humble one.\\nAnd it is always the humble man who talks too much; the proud man\\nwatches himself too closely. He defended respectability with\\nviolence and exaggeration. He grew passionate in his praise of\\ntidiness and propriety. All the time there was a smell of lilac\\nall round him. Once he heard very faintly in some distant street a\\nbarrel-organ begin to play, and it seemed to him that his heroic\\nwords were moving to a tiny tune from under or beyond the world.\\n\\nHe stared and talked at the girl\\'s red hair and amused face for\\nwhat seemed to be a few minutes; and then, feeling that the groups\\nin such a place should mix, rose to his feet. To his astonishment,\\nhe discovered the whole garden empty. Everyone had gone long ago,\\nand he went himself with a rather hurried apology. He left with a\\nsense of champagne in his head, which he could not afterwards\\nexplain. In the wild events which were to follow this girl had no\\npart at all; he never saw her again until all his tale was over.\\nAnd yet, in some indescribable way, she kept recurring like a\\nmotive in music through all his mad adventures afterwards, and the\\nglory of her strange hair ran like a red thread through those dark\\nand ill-drawn tapestries of the night. For what followed was so\\nimprobable, that it might well have been a dream.\\n\\nWhen Syme went out into the starlit street, he found it for the\\nmoment empty. Then he realised (in some odd way) that the silence\\nwas rather a living silence than a dead one. Directly outside the\\ndoor stood a street lamp, whose gleam gilded the leaves of the tree\\nthat bent out over the fence behind him. About a foot from the\\nlamp-post stood a figure almost as rigid and motionless as the\\nlamp-post itself. The tall hat and long frock coat were black; the\\nface, in an abrupt shadow, was almost as dark. Only a fringe of\\nfiery hair against the light, and also something aggressive in the\\nattitude, proclaimed that it was the poet Gregory. He had something\\nof the look of a masked bravo waiting sword in hand for his foe.\\n\\nHe made a sort of doubtful salute, which Syme somewhat more\\nformally returned.\\n\\n\"I was waiting for you,\" said Gregory. \"Might I have a moment\\'s\\nconversation?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. About what?\" asked Syme in a sort of weak wonder.\\n\\nGregory struck out with his stick at the lamp-post, and then at the\\ntree. \"About this and this,\" he cried; \"about order and anarchy.\\nThere is your precious order, that lean, iron lamp, ugly and\\nbarren; and there is anarchy, rich, living, reproducing\\nitself--there is anarchy, splendid in green and gold.\"\\n\\n\"All the same,\" replied Syme patiently, \"just at present you only\\nsee the tree by the light of the lamp. I wonder when you would ever\\nsee the lamp by the light of the tree.\" Then after a pause he said,\\n\"But may I ask if you have been standing out here in the dark only\\nto resume our little argument?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" cried out Gregory, in a voice that rang down the street, \"I\\ndid not stand here to resume our argument, but to end it for ever.\"\\n\\nThe silence fell again, and Syme, though he understood nothing,\\nlistened instinctively for something serious. Gregory began in a\\nsmooth voice and with a rather bewildering smile.\\n\\n\"Mr. Syme,\" he said, \"this evening you succeeded in doing something\\nrather remarkable. You did something to me that no man born of\\nwoman has ever succeeded in doing before.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed!\"\\n\\n\"Now I remember,\" resumed Gregory reflectively, \"one other person\\nsucceeded in doing it. The captain of a penny steamer (if I\\nremember correctly) at Southend. You have irritated me.\"\\n\\n\"I am very sorry,\" replied Syme with gravity.\\n\\n\"I am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wiped\\nout even with an apology,\" said Gregory very calmly. \"No duel\\ncould wipe it out. If I struck you dead I could not wipe it out.\\nThere is only one way by which that insult can be erased, and that\\nway I choose. I am going, at the possible sacrifice of my life and\\nhonour, to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said.\"\\n\\n\"In what I said?\"\\n\\n\"You said I was not serious about being an anarchist.\"\\n\\n\"There are degrees of seriousness,\" replied Syme. \"I have never\\ndoubted that you were perfectly sincere in this sense, that you\\nthought what you said well worth saying, that you thought a\\nparadox might wake men up to a neglected truth.\"\\n\\nGregory stared at him steadily and painfully.\\n\\n\"And in no other sense,\" he asked, \"you think me serious? You think\\nme a flaneur who lets fall occasional truths. You do not think that\\nin a deeper, a more deadly sense, I am serious.\"\\n\\nSyme struck his stick violently on the stones of the road.\\n\\n\"Serious!\" he cried. \"Good Lord! is this street serious? Are these\\ndamned Chinese lanterns serious? Is the whole caboodle serious?\\nOne comes here and talks a pack of bosh, and perhaps some sense as\\nwell, but I should think very little of a man who didn\\'t keep\\nsomething in the background of his life that was more serious than\\nall this talking--something more serious, whether it was religion\\nor only drink.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said Gregory, his face darkening, \"you shall see\\nsomething more serious than either drink or religion.\"\\n\\nSyme stood waiting with his usual air of mildness until Gregory\\nagain opened his lips.\\n\\n\"You spoke just now of having a religion. Is it really true that\\nyou have one?\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Syme with a beaming smile, \"we are all Catholics now.\"\\n\\n\"Then may I ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints your\\nreligion involves that you will not reveal what I am now going to\\ntell you to any son of Adam, and especially not to the police?\\nWill you swear that! If you will take upon yourself this awful\\nabnegations if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow\\nthat you should never make and a knowledge you should never dream\\nabout, I will promise you in return--\"\\n\\n\"You will promise me in return?\" inquired Syme, as the other\\npaused.\\n\\n\"I will promise you a very entertaining evening.\" Syme suddenly\\ntook off his hat.\\n\\n\"Your offer,\" he said, \"is far too idiotic to be declined. You say\\nthat a poet is always an anarchist. I disagree; but I hope at least\\nthat he is always a sportsman. Permit me, here and now, to swear as\\na Christian, and promise as a good comrade and a fellow-artist,\\nthat I will not report anything of this, whatever it is, to the\\npolice. And now, in the name of Colney Hatch, what is it?\"\\n\\n\"I think,\" said Gregory, with placid irrelevancy, \"that we will\\ncall a cab.\"\\n\\nHe gave two long whistles, and a hansom came rattling down the\\nroad. The two got into it in silence. Gregory gave through the\\ntrap the address of an obscure public-house on the Chiswick bank\\nof the river. The cab whisked itself away again, and in it these\\ntwo fantastics quitted their fantastic town.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nTHE SECRET OF GABRIEL SYME\\n\\nTHE cab pulled up before a particularly dreary and greasy beershop,\\ninto which Gregory rapidly conducted his companion. They seated\\nthemselves in a close and dim sort of bar-parlour, at a stained\\nwooden table with one wooden leg. The room was so small and dark,\\nthat very little could be seen of the attendant who was summoned,\\nbeyond a vague and dark impression of something bulky and bearded.\\n\\n\"Will you take a little supper?\" asked Gregory politely. \"The pate\\nde foie gras is not good here, but I can recommend the game.\"\\n\\nSyme received the remark with stolidity, imagining it to be a joke.\\nAccepting the vein of humour, he said, with a well-bred\\nindifference--\\n\\n\"Oh, bring me some lobster mayonnaise.\"\\n\\nTo his indescribable astonishment, the man only said \"Certainly,\\nsir!\" and went away apparently to get it.\\n\\n\"What will you drink?\" resumed Gregory, with the same careless yet\\napologetic air. \"I shall only have a crepe de menthe myself; I have\\ndined. But the champagne can really be trusted. Do let me start you\\nwith a half-bottle of Pommery at least?\"\\n\\n\"Thank you!\" said the motionless Syme. \"You are very good.\"\\n\\nHis further attempts at conversation, somewhat disorganised in\\nthemselves, were cut short finally as by a thunderbolt by the\\nactual appearance of the lobster. Syme tasted it, and found it\\nparticularly good. Then he suddenly began to eat with great\\nrapidity and appetite.\\n\\n\"Excuse me if I enjoy myself rather obviously!\" he said to Gregory,\\nsmiling. \"I don\\'t often have the luck to have a dream like this. It\\nis new to me for a nightmare to lead to a lobster. It is commonly\\nthe other way.\"\\n\\n\"You are not asleep, I assure you,\" said Gregory. \"You are, on the\\ncontrary, close to the most actual and rousing moment of your\\nexistence. Ah, here comes your champagne! I admit that there may be\\na slight disproportion, let us say, between the inner arrangements\\nof this excellent hotel and its simple and unpretentious exterior.\\nBut that is all our modesty. We are the most modest men that ever\\nlived on earth.\"\\n\\n\"And who are we?\" asked Syme, emptying his champagne glass.\\n\\n\"It is quite simple,\" replied Gregory. \"We are the serious\\nanarchists, in whom you do not believe.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Syme shortly. \"You do yourselves well in drinks.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we are serious about everything,\" answered Gregory.\\n\\nThen after a pause he added--\\n\\n\"If in a few moments this table begins to turn round a little,\\ndon\\'t put it down to your inroads into the champagne. I don\\'t wish\\nyou to do yourself an injustice.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if I am not drunk, I am mad,\" replied Syme with perfect\\ncalm; \"but I trust I can behave like a gentleman in either\\ncondition. May I smoke?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly!\" said Gregory, producing a cigar-case. \"Try one of\\nmine.\"\\n\\nSyme took the cigar, clipped the end off with a cigar-cutter out\\nof his waistcoat pocket, put it in his mouth, lit it slowly, and\\nlet out a long cloud of smoke. It is not a little to his credit\\nthat he performed these rites with so much composure, for almost\\nbefore he had begun them the table at which he sat had begun to\\nrevolve, first slowly, and then rapidly, as if at an insane\\nseance.\\n\\n\"You must not mind it,\" said Gregory; \"it\\'s a kind of screw.\"\\n\\n\"Quite so,\" said Syme placidly, \"a kind of screw. How simple that\\nis!\"\\n\\nThe next moment the smoke of his cigar, which had been wavering\\nacross the room in snaky twists, went straight up as if from a\\nfactory chimney, and the two, with their chairs and table, shot\\ndown through the floor as if the earth had swallowed them. They\\nwent rattling down a kind of roaring chimney as rapidly as a lift\\ncut loose, and they came with an abrupt bump to the bottom. But\\nwhen Gregory threw open a pair of doors and let in a red\\nsubterranean light, Syme was still smoking with one leg thrown\\nover the other, and had not turned a yellow hair.\\n\\nGregory led him down a low, vaulted passage, at the end of which\\nwas the red light. It was an enormous crimson lantern, nearly as\\nbig as a fireplace, fixed over a small but heavy iron door. In the\\ndoor there was a sort of hatchway or grating, and on this Gregory\\nstruck five times. A heavy voice with a foreign accent asked him\\nwho he was. To this he gave the more or less unexpected reply,\\n\"Mr. Joseph Chamberlain.\" The heavy hinges began to move; it was\\nobviously some kind of password.\\n\\nInside the doorway the passage gleamed as if it were lined with a\\nnetwork of steel. On a second glance, Syme saw that the glittering\\npattern was really made up of ranks and ranks of rifles and\\nrevolvers, closely packed or interlocked.\\n\\n\"I must ask you to forgive me all these formalities,\" said Gregory;\\n\"we have to be very strict here.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t apologise,\" said Syme. \"I know your passion for law and\\norder,\" and he stepped into the passage lined with the steel\\nweapons. With his long, fair hair and rather foppish frock-coat, he\\nlooked a singularly frail and fanciful figure as he walked down\\nthat shining avenue of death.\\n\\nThey passed through several such passages, and came out at last\\ninto a queer steel chamber with curved walls, almost spherical in\\nshape, but presenting, with its tiers of benches, something of the\\nappearance of a scientific lecture-theatre. There were no rifles or\\npistols in this apartment, but round the walls of it were hung more\\ndubious and dreadful shapes, things that looked like the bulbs of\\niron plants, or the eggs of iron birds. They were bombs, and the\\nvery room itself seemed like the inside of a bomb. Syme knocked his\\ncigar ash off against the wall, and went in.\\n\\n\"And now, my dear Mr. Syme,\" said Gregory, throwing himself in an\\nexpansive manner on the bench under the largest bomb, \"now we are\\nquite cosy, so let us talk properly. Now no human words can give\\nyou any notion of why I brought you here. It was one of those quite\\narbitrary emotions, like jumping off a cliff or falling in love.\\nSuffice it to say that you were an inexpressibly irritating fellow,\\nand, to do you justice, you are still. I would break twenty oaths\\nof secrecy for the pleasure of taking you down a peg. That way you\\nhave of lighting a cigar would make a priest break the seal of\\nconfession. Well, you said that you were quite certain I was not a\\nserious anarchist. Does this place strike you as being serious?\"\\n\\n\"It does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety,\" assented\\nSyme; \"but may I ask you two questions? You need not fear to give\\nme information, because, as you remember, you very wisely extorted\\nfrom me a promise not to tell the police, a promise I shall\\ncertainly keep. So it is in mere curiosity that I make my queries.\\nFirst of all, what is it really all about? What is it you object\\nto? You want to abolish Government?\"\\n\\n\"To abolish God!\" said Gregory, opening the eyes of a fanatic. \"We\\ndo not only want to upset a few despotisms and police regulations;\\nthat sort of anarchism does exist, but it is a mere branch of the\\nNonconformists. We dig deeper and we blow you higher. We wish to\\ndeny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice and virtue, honour\\nand treachery, upon which mere rebels base themselves. The silly\\nsentimentalists of the French Revolution talked of the Rights of\\nMan! We hate Rights as we hate Wrongs. We have abolished Right and\\nWrong.\"\\n\\n\"And Right and Left,\" said Syme with a simple eagerness, \"I hope\\nyou will abolish them too. They are much more troublesome to me.\"\\n\\n\"You spoke of a second question,\" snapped Gregory.\\n\\n\"With pleasure,\" resumed Syme. \"In all your present acts and\\nsurroundings there is a scientific attempt at secrecy. I have an\\naunt who lived over a shop, but this is the first time I have\\nfound people living from preference under a public-house. You have\\na heavy iron door. You cannot pass it without submitting to the\\nhumiliation of calling yourself Mr. Chamberlain. You surround\\nyourself with steel instruments which make the place, if I may say\\nso, more impressive than homelike. May I ask why, after taking all\\nthis trouble to barricade yourselves in the bowels of the earth,\\nyou then parade your whole secret by talking about anarchism to\\nevery silly woman in Saffron Park?\"\\n\\nGregory smiled.\\n\\n\"The answer is simple,\" he said. \"I told you I was a serious\\nanarchist, and you did not believe me. Nor do they believe me.\\nUnless I took them into this infernal room they would not believe\\nme.\"\\n\\nSyme smoked thoughtfully, and looked at him with interest. Gregory\\nwent on.\\n\\n\"The history of the thing might amuse you,\" he said. \"When first I\\nbecame one of the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectable\\ndisguises. I dressed up as a bishop. I read up all about bishops\\nin our anarchist pamphlets, in Superstition the Vampire and\\nPriests of Prey. I certainly understood from them that bishops are\\nstrange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret from mankind.\\nI was misinformed. When on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters\\nin a drawing-room I cried out in a voice of thunder, \\'Down! down!\\npresumptuous human reason!\\' they found out in some way that I was\\nnot a bishop at all. I was nabbed at once. Then I made up as a\\nmillionaire; but I defended Capital with so much intelligence that\\na fool could see that I was quite poor. Then I tried being a\\nmajor. Now I am a humanitarian myself, but I have, I hope, enough\\nintellectual breadth to understand the position of those who, like\\nNietzsche, admire violence--the proud, mad war of Nature and all\\nthat, you know. I threw myself into the major. I drew my sword and\\nwaved it constantly. I called out \\'Blood!\\' abstractedly, like a\\nman calling for wine. I often said, \\'Let the weak perish; it is\\nthe Law.\\' Well, well, it seems majors don\\'t do this. I was nabbed\\nagain. At last I went in despair to the President of the Central\\nAnarchist Council, who is the greatest man in Europe.\"\\n\\n\"What is his name?\" asked Syme.\\n\\n\"You would not know it,\" answered Gregory. \"That is his greatness.\\nCaesar and Napoleon put all their genius into being heard of, and\\nthey were heard of. He puts all his genius into not being heard of,\\nand he is not heard of. But you cannot be for five minutes in the\\nroom with him without feeling that Caesar and Napoleon would have\\nbeen children in his hands.\"\\n\\nHe was silent and even pale for a moment, and then resumed--\\n\\n\"But whenever he gives advice it is always something as startling\\nas an epigram, and yet as practical as the Bank of England. I said\\nto him, \\'What disguise will hide me from the world? What can I find\\nmore respectable than bishops and majors?\\' He looked at me with his\\nlarge but indecipherable face. \\'You want a safe disguise, do you?\\nYou want a dress which will guarantee you harmless; a dress in\\nwhich no one would ever look for a bomb?\\' I nodded. He suddenly\\nlifted his lion\\'s voice. \\'Why, then, dress up as an anarchist, you\\nfool!\\' he roared so that the room shook. \\'Nobody will ever expect\\nyou to do anything dangerous then.\\' And he turned his broad back\\non me without another word. I took his advice, and have never\\nregretted it. I preached blood and murder to those women day and\\nnight, and--by God!--they would let me wheel their perambulators.\"\\n\\nSyme sat watching him with some respect in his large, blue eyes.\\n\\n\"You took me in,\" he said. \"It is really a smart dodge.\"\\n\\nThen after a pause he added--\\n\\n\"What do you call this tremendous President of yours?\"\\n\\n\"We generally call him Sunday,\" replied Gregory with simplicity.\\n\\'You see, there are seven members of the Central Anarchist\\nCouncil, and they are named after days of the week. He is called\\nSunday, by some of his admirers Bloody Sunday. It is curious you\\nshould mention the matter, because the very night you have dropped\\nin (if I may so express it) is the night on which our London\\nbranch, which assembles in this room, has to elect its own deputy\\nto fill a vacancy in the Council. The gentleman who has for some\\ntime past played, with propriety and general applause, the\\ndifficult part of Thursday, has died quite suddenly. Consequently,\\nwe have called a meeting this very evening to elect a successor.\"\\n\\nHe got to his feet and strolled across the room with a sort of\\nsmiling embarrassment.\\n\\n\"I feel somehow as if you were my mother, Syme,\" he continued\\ncasually. \"I feel that I can confide anything to you, as you have\\npromised to tell nobody. In fact, I will confide to you something\\nthat I would not say in so many words to the anarchists who will be\\ncoming to the room in about ten minutes. We shall, of course, go\\nthrough a form of election; but I don\\'t mind telling you that it is\\npractically certain what the result will be.\" He looked down for a\\nmoment modestly. \"It is almost a settled thing that I am to be\\nThursday.\"\\n\\n\"My dear fellow.\" said Syme heartily, \"I congratulate you. A great\\ncareer!\"\\n\\nGregory smiled in deprecation, and walked across the room, talking\\nrapidly.\\n\\n\"As a matter of fact, everything is ready for me on this table,\" he\\nsaid, \"and the ceremony will probably be the shortest possible.\"\\n\\nSyme also strolled across to the table, and found lying across it a\\nwalking-stick, which turned out on examination to be a sword-stick,\\na large Colt\\'s revolver, a sandwich case, and a formidable flask of\\nbrandy. Over the chair, beside the table, was thrown a\\nheavy-looking cape or cloak.\\n\\n\"I have only to get the form of election finished,\" continued\\nGregory with animation, \"then I snatch up this cloak and stick,\\nstuff these other things into my pocket, step out of a door in\\nthis cavern, which opens on the river, where there is a steam-tug\\nalready waiting for me, and then--then--oh, the wild joy of being\\nThursday!\" And he clasped his hands.\\n\\nSyme, who had sat down once more with his usual insolent languor,\\ngot to his feet with an unusual air of hesitation.\\n\\n\"Why is it,\" he asked vaguely, \"that I think you are quite a decent\\nfellow? Why do I positively like you, Gregory?\" He paused a moment,\\nand then added with a sort of fresh curiosity, \"Is it because you\\nare such an ass?\"\\n\\nThere was a thoughtful silence again, and then he cried out--\\n\\n\"Well, damn it all! this is the funniest situation I have ever been\\nin in my life, and I am going to act accordingly. Gregory, I gave\\nyou a promise before I came into this place. That promise I would\\nkeep under red-hot pincers. Would you give me, for my own safety, a\\nlittle promise of the same kind? \"\\n\\n\"A promise?\" asked Gregory, wondering.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Syme very seriously, \"a promise. I swore before God\\nthat I would not tell your secret to the police. Will you swear by\\nHumanity, or whatever beastly thing you believe in, that you will\\nnot tell my secret to the anarchists?\"\\n\\n\"Your secret?\" asked the staring Gregory. \"Have you got a secret?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Syme, \"I have a secret.\" Then after a pause, \"Will you\\nswear?\"\\n\\nGregory glared at him gravely for a few moments, and then said\\nabruptly--\\n\\n\"You must have bewitched me, but I feel a furious curiosity about\\nyou. Yes, I will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tell\\nme. But look sharp, for they will be here in a couple of minutes.\"\\n\\nSyme rose slowly to his feet and thrust his long, white hands into\\nhis long, grey trousers\\' pockets. Almost as he did so there came\\nfive knocks on the outer grating, proclaiming the arrival of the\\nfirst of the conspirators.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Syme slowly, \"I don\\'t know how to tell you the truth\\nmore shortly than by saying that your expedient of dressing up as\\nan aimless poet is not confined to you or your President. We have\\nknown the dodge for some time at Scotland Yard.\"\\n\\nGregory tried to spring up straight, but he swayed thrice.\\n\\n\"What do you say?\" he asked in an inhuman voice.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Syme simply, \"I am a police detective. But I think I\\nhear your friends coming.\"\\n\\nFrom the doorway there came a murmur of \"Mr. Joseph Chamberlain.\"\\nIt was repeated twice and thrice, and then thirty times, and the\\ncrowd of Joseph Chamberlains (a solemn thought) could be heard\\ntrampling down the corridor.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nTHE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY\\n\\nBEFORE one of the fresh faces could appear at the doorway,\\nGregory\\'s stunned surprise had fallen from him. He was beside the\\ntable with a bound, and a noise in his throat like a wild beast.\\nHe caught up the Colt\\'s revolver and took aim at Syme. Syme did\\nnot flinch, but he put up a pale and polite hand.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be such a silly man,\" he said, with the effeminate dignity\\nof a curate. \"Don\\'t you see it\\'s not necessary? Don\\'t you see that\\nwe\\'re both in the same boat? Yes, and jolly sea-sick.\"\\n\\nGregory could not speak, but he could not fire either, and he\\nlooked his question.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you see we\\'ve checkmated each other?\" cried Syme. \"I can\\'t\\ntell the police you are an anarchist. You can\\'t tell the anarchists\\nI\\'m a policeman. I can only watch you, knowing what you are; you\\ncan only watch me, knowing what I am. In short, it\\'s a lonely,\\nintellectual duel, my head against yours. I\\'m a policeman deprived\\nof the help of the police. You, my poor fellow, are an anarchist\\ndeprived of the help of that law and organisation which is so\\nessential to anarchy. The one solitary difference is in your\\nfavour. You are not surrounded by inquisitive policemen; I am\\nsurrounded by inquisitive anarchists. I cannot betray you, but I\\nmight betray myself. Come, come! wait and see me betray myself. I\\nshall do it so nicely.\"\\n\\nGregory put the pistol slowly down, still staring at Syme as if he\\nwere a sea-monster.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe in immortality,\" he said at last, \"but if, after\\nall this, you were to break your word, God would make a hell only\\nfor you, to howl in for ever.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not break my word,\" said Syme sternly, \"nor will you\\nbreak yours. Here are your friends.\"\\n\\nThe mass of the anarchists entered the room heavily, with a\\nslouching and somewhat weary gait; but one little man, with a\\nblack beard and glasses--a man somewhat of the type of Mr. Tim\\nHealy--detached himself, and bustled forward with some papers\\nin his hand.\\n\\n\"Comrade Gregory,\" he said, \"I suppose this man is a delegate?\"\\n\\nGregory, taken by surprise, looked down and muttered the name of\\nSyme; but Syme replied almost pertly--\\n\\n\"I am glad to see that your gate is well enough guarded to make it\\nhard for anyone to be here who was not a delegate.\"\\n\\nThe brow of the little man with the black beard was, however, still\\ncontracted with something like suspicion.\\n\\n\"What branch do you represent?\" he asked sharply.\\n\\n\"I should hardly call it a branch,\" said Syme, laughing; \"I should\\ncall it at the very least a root.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"The fact is,\" said Syme serenely, \"the truth is I am a\\nSabbatarian. I have been specially sent here to see that you show\\na due observance of Sunday.\"\\n\\nThe little man dropped one of his papers, and a flicker of fear\\nwent over all the faces of the group. Evidently the awful\\nPresident, whose name was Sunday, did sometimes send down such\\nirregular ambassadors to such branch meetings.\\n\\n\"Well, comrade,\" said the man with the papers after a pause, \"I\\nsuppose we\\'d better give you a seat in the meeting?\"\\n\\n\"If you ask my advice as a friend,\" said Syme with severe\\nbenevolence, \"I think you\\'d better.\"\\n\\nWhen Gregory heard the dangerous dialogue end, with a sudden safety\\nfor his rival, he rose abruptly and paced the floor in painful\\nthought. He was, indeed, in an agony of diplomacy. It was clear\\nthat Syme\\'s inspired impudence was likely to bring him out of all\\nmerely accidental dilemmas. Little was to be hoped from them. He\\ncould not himself betray Syme, partly from honour, but partly also\\nbecause, if he betrayed him and for some reason failed to destroy\\nhim, the Syme who escaped would be a Syme freed from all obligation\\nof secrecy, a Syme who would simply walk to the nearest police\\nstation. After all, it was only one night\\'s discussion, and only\\none detective who would know of it. He would let out as little as\\npossible of their plans that night, and then let Syme go, and\\nchance it.\\n\\nHe strode across to the group of anarchists, which was already\\ndistributing itself along the benches.\\n\\n\"I think it is time we began,\" he said; \"the steam-tug is waiting\\non the river already. I move that Comrade Buttons takes the chair.\"\\n\\nThis being approved by a show of hands, the little man with the\\npapers slipped into the presidential seat.\\n\\n\"Comrades,\" he began, as sharp as a pistol-shot, \"our meeting\\ntonight is important, though it need not be long. This branch\\nhas always had the honour of electing Thursdays for the Central\\nEuropean Council. We have elected many and splendid Thursdays. We\\nall lament the sad decease of the heroic worker who occupied the\\npost until last week. As you know, his services to the cause were\\nconsiderable. He organised the great dynamite coup of Brighton\\nwhich, under happier circumstances, ought to have killed everybody\\non the pier. As you also know, his death was as self-denying as\\nhis life, for he died through his faith in a hygienic mixture of\\nchalk and water as a substitute for milk, which beverage he\\nregarded as barbaric, and as involving cruelty to the cow.\\nCruelty, or anything approaching to cruelty, revolted him always.\\nBut it is not to acclaim his virtues that we are met, but for a\\nharder task. It is difficult properly to praise his qualities, but\\nit is more difficult to replace them. Upon you, comrades, it\\ndevolves this evening to choose out of the company present the man\\nwho shall be Thursday. If any comrade suggests a name I will put\\nit to the vote. If no comrade suggests a name, I can only tell\\nmyself that that dear dynamiter, who is gone from us, has carried\\ninto the unknowable abysses the last secret of his virtue and his\\ninnocence.\"\\n\\nThere was a stir of almost inaudible applause, such as is sometimes\\nheard in church. Then a large old man, with a long and venerable\\nwhite beard, perhaps the only real working-man present, rose\\nlumberingly and said--\\n\\n\"I move that Comrade Gregory be elected Thursday,\" and sat\\nlumberingly down again.\\n\\n\"Does anyone second?\" asked the chairman.\\n\\nA little man with a velvet coat and pointed beard seconded.\\n\\n\"Before I put the matter to the vote,\" said the chairman, \"I will\\ncall on Comrade Gregory to make a statement.\"\\n\\nGregory rose amid a great rumble of applause. His face was deadly\\npale, so that by contrast his queer red hair looked almost scarlet.\\nBut he was smiling and altogether at ease. He had made up his mind,\\nand he saw his best policy quite plain in front of him like a white\\nroad. His best chance was to make a softened and ambiguous speech,\\nsuch as would leave on the detective\\'s mind the impression that the\\nanarchist brotherhood was a very mild affair after all. He believed\\nin his own literary power, his capacity for suggesting fine shades\\nand picking perfect words. He thought that with care he could\\nsucceed, in spite of all the people around him, in conveying an\\nimpression of the institution, subtly and delicately false. Syme\\nhad once thought that anarchists, under all their bravado, were\\nonly playing the fool. Could he not now, in the hour of peril, make\\nSyme think so again?\\n\\n\"Comrades,\" began Gregory, in a low but penetrating voice, \"it is\\nnot necessary for me to tell you what is my policy, for it is your\\npolicy also. Our belief has been slandered, it has been disfigured,\\nit has been utterly confused and concealed, but it has never been\\naltered. Those who talk about anarchism and its dangers go\\neverywhere and anywhere to get their information, except to us,\\nexcept to the fountain head. They learn about anarchists from\\nsixpenny novels; they learn about anarchists from tradesmen\\'s\\nnewspapers; they learn about anarchists from Ally Sloper\\'s\\nHalf-Holiday and the Sporting Times. They never learn about\\nanarchists from anarchists. We have no chance of denying the\\nmountainous slanders which are heaped upon our heads from one end\\nof Europe to another. The man who has always heard that we are\\nwalking plagues has never heard our reply. I know that he will not\\nhear it tonight, though my passion were to rend the roof. For it is\\ndeep, deep under the earth that the persecuted are permitted to\\nassemble, as the Christians assembled in the Catacombs. But if, by\\nsome incredible accident, there were here tonight a man who all his\\nlife had thus immensely misunderstood us, I would put this question\\nto him: \\'When those Christians met in those Catacombs, what sort of\\nmoral reputation had they in the streets above? What tales were\\ntold of their atrocities by one educated Roman to another? Suppose\\'\\n(I would say to him), \\'suppose that we are only repeating that\\nstill mysterious paradox of history. Suppose we seem as shocking as\\nthe Christians because we are really as harmless as the Christians.\\nSuppose we seem as mad as the Christians because we are really as\\nmeek.\"\\'\\n\\nThe applause that had greeted the opening sentences had been\\ngradually growing fainter, and at the last word it stopped\\nsuddenly. In the abrupt silence, the man with the velvet jacket\\nsaid, in a high, squeaky voice--\\n\\n\"I\\'m not meek!\"\\n\\n\"Comrade Witherspoon tells us,\" resumed Gregory, \"that he is not\\nmeek. Ah, how little he knows himself! His words are, indeed,\\nextravagant; his appearance is ferocious, and even (to an ordinary\\ntaste) unattractive. But only the eye of a friendship as deep and\\ndelicate as mine can perceive the deep foundation of solid meekness\\nwhich lies at the base of him, too deep even for himself to see. I\\nrepeat, we are the true early Christians, only that we come too\\nlate. We are simple, as they revere simple--look at Comrade\\nWitherspoon. We are modest, as they were modest--look at me. We are\\nmerciful--\"\\n\\n\"No, no!\" called out Mr. Witherspoon with the velvet jacket.\\n\\n\"I say we are merciful,\" repeated Gregory furiously, \"as the early\\nChristians were merciful. Yet this did not prevent their being\\naccused of eating human flesh. We do not eat human flesh--\"\\n\\n\"Shame!\" cried Witherspoon. \"Why not?\"\\n\\n\"Comrade Witherspoon,\" said Gregory, with a feverish gaiety, \"is\\nanxious to know why nobody eats him (laughter). In our society, at\\nany rate, which loves him sincerely, which is founded upon love--\"\\n\\n\"No, no!\" said Witherspoon, \"down with love.\"\\n\\n\"Which is founded upon love,\" repeated Gregory, grinding his teeth,\\n\"there will be no difficulty about the aims which we shall pursue\\nas a body, or which I should pursue were I chosen as the\\nrepresentative of that body. Superbly careless of the slanders that\\nrepresent us as assassins and enemies of human society, we shall\\npursue with moral courage and quiet intellectual pressure, the\\npermanent ideals of brotherhood and simplicity.\"\\n\\nGregory resumed his seat and passed his hand across his forehead.\\nThe silence was sudden and awkward, but the chairman rose like an\\nautomaton, and said in a colourless voice--\\n\\n\"Does anyone oppose the election of Comrade Gregory?\"\\n\\nThe assembly seemed vague and sub-consciously disappointed, and\\nComrade Witherspoon moved restlessly on his seat and muttered in\\nhis thick beard. By the sheer rush of routine, however, the motion\\nwould have been put and carried. But as the chairman was opening\\nhis mouth to put it, Syme sprang to his feet and said in a small\\nand quiet voice--\\n\\n\"Yes, Mr. Chairman, I oppose.\"\\n\\nThe most effective fact in oratory is an unexpected change in the\\nvoice. Mr. Gabriel Syme evidently understood oratory. Having said\\nthese first formal words in a moderated tone and with a brief\\nsimplicity, he made his next word ring and volley in the vault as\\nif one of the guns had gone off.\\n\\n\"Comrades!\" he cried, in a voice that made every man jump out of\\nhis boots, \"have we come here for this? Do we live underground like\\nrats in order to listen to talk like this? This is talk we might\\nlisten to while eating buns at a Sunday School treat. Do we line\\nthese walls with weapons and bar that door with death lest anyone\\nshould come and hear Comrade Gregory saying to us, \\'Be good, and\\nyou will be happy,\\' \\'Honesty is the best policy,\\' and \\'Virtue is\\nits own reward\\'? There was not a word in Comrade Gregory\\'s address\\nto which a curate could not have listened with pleasure (hear,\\nhear). But I am not a curate (loud cheers), and I did not listen to\\nit with pleasure (renewed cheers). The man who is fitted to make a\\ngood curate is not fitted to make a resolute, forcible, and\\nefficient Thursday (hear, hear).\"\\n\\n\"Comrade Gregory has told us, in only too apologetic a tone, that\\nwe are not the enemies of society. But I say that we are the\\nenemies of society, and so much the worse for society. We are the\\nenemies of society, for society is the enemy of humanity, its\\noldest and its most pitiless enemy (hear, hear). Comrade Gregory\\nhas told us (apologetically again) that we are not murderers. There\\nI agree. We are not murderers, we are executioners (cheers).\"\\n\\nEver since Syme had risen Gregory had sat staring at him, his face\\nidiotic with astonishment. Now in the pause his lips of clay\\nparted, and he said, with an automatic and lifeless distinctness--\\n\\n\"You damnable hypocrite!\"\\n\\nSyme looked straight into those frightful eyes with his own pale\\nblue ones, and said with dignity--\\n\\n\"Comrade Gregory accuses me of hypocrisy. He knows as well as I do\\nthat I am keeping all my engagements and doing nothing but my duty.\\nI do not mince words. I do not pretend to. I say that Comrade\\nGregory is unfit to be Thursday for all his amiable qualities. He\\nis unfit to be Thursday because of his amiable qualities. We do not\\nwant the Supreme Council of Anarchy infected with a maudlin mercy\\n(hear, hear). This is no time for ceremonial politeness, neither is\\nit a time for ceremonial modesty. I set myself against Comrade\\nGregory as I would set myself against all the Governments of\\nEurope, because the anarchist who has given himself to anarchy has\\nforgotten modesty as much as he has forgotten pride (cheers). I am\\nnot a man at all. I am a cause (renewed cheers). I set myself\\nagainst Comrade Gregory as impersonally and as calmly as I should\\nchoose one pistol rather than another out of that rack upon the\\nwall; and I say that rather than have Gregory and his\\nmilk-and-water methods on the Supreme Council, I would offer myself\\nfor election--\"\\n\\nHis sentence was drowned in a deafening cataract of applause. The\\nfaces, that had grown fiercer and fiercer with approval as his\\ntirade grew more and more uncompromising, were now distorted with\\ngrins of anticipation or cloven with delighted cries. At the\\nmoment when he announced himself as ready to stand for the post of\\nThursday, a roar of excitement and assent broke forth, and became\\nuncontrollable, and at the same moment Gregory sprang to his feet,\\nwith foam upon his mouth, and shouted against the shouting.\\n\\n\"Stop, you blasted madmen!\" he cried, at the top of a voice that\\ntore his throat. \"Stop, you--\"\\n\\nBut louder than Gregory\\'s shouting and louder than the roar of the\\nroom came the voice of Syme, still speaking in a peal of pitiless\\nthunder--\\n\\n\"I do not go to the Council to rebut that slander that calls us\\nmurderers; I go to earn it (loud and prolonged cheering). To the\\npriest who says these men are the enemies of religion, to the\\njudge who says these men are the enemies of law, to the fat\\nparliamentarian who says these men are the enemies of order and\\npublic decency, to all these I will reply, \\'You are false kings,\\nbut you are true prophets. I am come to destroy you, and to fulfil\\nyour prophecies.\\'\"\\n\\nThe heavy clamour gradually died away, but before it had ceased\\nWitherspoon had jumped to his feet, his hair and beard all on end,\\nand had said--\\n\\n\"I move, as an amendment, that Comrade Syme be appointed to the post.\"\\n\\n\"Stop all this, I tell you!\" cried Gregory, with frantic face and\\nhands. \"Stop it, it is all--\"\\n\\nThe voice of the chairman clove his speech with a cold accent.\\n\\n\"Does anyone second this amendment?\" he said. A tall, tired man,\\nwith melancholy eyes and an American chin beard, was observed on\\nthe back bench to be slowly rising to his feet. Gregory had been\\nscreaming for some time past; now there was a change in his accent,\\nmore shocking than any scream. \"I end all this!\" he said, in a\\nvoice as heavy as stone.\\n\\n\"This man cannot be elected. He is a--\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Syme, quite motionless, \"what is he?\" Gregory\\'s mouth\\nworked twice without sound; then slowly the blood began to crawl\\nback into his dead face. \"He is a man quite inexperienced in our\\nwork,\" he said, and sat down abruptly.\\n\\nBefore he had done so, the long, lean man with the American beard\\nwas again upon his feet, and was repeating in a high American\\nmonotone--\\n\\n\"I beg to second the election of Comrade Syme.\"\\n\\n\"The amendment will, as usual, be put first,\" said Mr. Buttons, the\\nchairman, with mechanical rapidity.\\n\\n\"The question is that Comrade Syme--\"\\n\\nGregory had again sprung to his feet, panting and passionate.\\n\\n\"Comrades,\" he cried out, \"I am not a madman.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, oh!\" said Mr. Witherspoon.\\n\\n\"I am not a madman,\" reiterated Gregory, with a frightful sincerity\\nwhich for a moment staggered the room, \"but I give you a counsel\\nwhich you can call mad if you like. No, I will not call it a\\ncounsel, for I can give you no reason for it. I will call it a\\ncommand. Call it a mad command, but act upon it. Strike, but hear\\nme! Kill me, but obey me! Do not elect this man.\" Truth is so\\nterrible, even in fetters, that for a moment Syme\\'s slender and\\ninsane victory swayed like a reed. But you could not have guessed\\nit from Syme\\'s bleak blue eyes. He merely began--\\n\\n\"Comrade Gregory commands--\"\\n\\nThen the spell was snapped, and one anarchist called out to Gregory--\\n\\n\"Who are you? You are not Sunday\"; and another anarchist added in a\\nheavier voice, \"And you are not Thursday.\"\\n\\n\"Comrades,\" cried Gregory, in a voice like that of a martyr who in\\nan ecstacy of pain has passed beyond pain, \"it is nothing to me\\nwhether you detest me as a tyrant or detest me as a slave. If you\\nwill not take my command, accept my degradation. I kneel to you. I\\nthrow myself at your feet. I implore you. Do not elect this man.\"\\n\\n\"Comrade Gregory,\" said the chairman after a painful pause, \"this\\nis really not quite dignified.\"\\n\\nFor the first time in the proceedings there was for a few seconds a\\nreal silence. Then Gregory fell back in his seat, a pale wreck of a\\nman, and the chairman repeated, like a piece of clock-work suddenly\\nstarted again--\\n\\n\"The question is that Comrade Syme be elected to the post of\\nThursday on the General Council.\"\\n\\nThe roar rose like the sea, the hands rose like a forest, and three\\nminutes afterwards Mr. Gabriel Syme, of the Secret Police Service,\\nwas elected to the post of Thursday on the General Council of the\\nAnarchists of Europe.\\n\\nEveryone in the room seemed to feel the tug waiting on the river,\\nthe sword-stick and the revolver, waiting on the table. The instant\\nthe election was ended and irrevocable, and Syme had received the\\npaper proving his election, they all sprang to their feet, and the\\nfiery groups moved and mixed in the room. Syme found himself,\\nsomehow or other, face to face with Gregory, who still regarded him\\nwith a stare of stunned hatred. They were silent for many minutes.\\n\\n\"You are a devil!\" said Gregory at last.\\n\\n\"And you are a gentleman,\" said Syme with gravity.\\n\\n\"It was you that entrapped me,\" began Gregory, shaking from head\\nto foot, \"entrapped me into--\"\\n\\n\"Talk sense,\" said Syme shortly. \"Into what sort of devils\\'\\nparliament have you entrapped me, if it comes to that? You made me\\nswear before I made you. Perhaps we are both doing what we think\\nright. But what we think right is so damned different that there\\ncan be nothing between us in the way of concession. There is\\nnothing possible between us but honour and death,\" and he pulled\\nthe great cloak about his shoulders and picked up the flask from\\nthe table.\\n\\n\"The boat is quite ready,\" said Mr. Buttons, bustling up. \"Be good\\nenough to step this way.\"\\n\\nWith a gesture that revealed the shop-walker, he led Syme down a\\nshort, iron-bound passage, the still agonised Gregory following\\nfeverishly at their heels. At the end of the passage was a door,\\nwhich Buttons opened sharply, showing a sudden blue and silver\\npicture of the moonlit river, that looked like a scene in a\\ntheatre. Close to the opening lay a dark, dwarfish steam-launch,\\nlike a baby dragon with one red eye.\\n\\nAlmost in the act of stepping on board, Gabriel Syme turned to the\\ngaping Gregory.\\n\\n\"You have kept your word,\" he said gently, with his face in shadow.\\n\"You are a man of honour, and I thank you. You have kept it even\\ndown to a small particular. There was one special thing you\\npromised me at the beginning of the affair, and which you have\\ncertainly given me by the end of it.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" cried the chaotic Gregory. \"What did I promise\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"A very entertaining evening,\" said Syme, and he made a military\\nsalute with the sword-stick as the steamboat slid away.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nTHE TALE OF A DETECTIVE\\n\\nGABRIEL SYME was not merely a detective who pretended to be a poet;\\nhe was really a poet who had become a detective. Nor was his hatred\\nof anarchy hypocritical. He was one of those who are driven early\\nin life into too conservative an attitude by the bewildering folly\\nof most revolutionists. He had not attained it by any tame\\ntradition. His respectability was spontaneous and sudden, a\\nrebellion against rebellion. He came of a family of cranks, in\\nwhich all the oldest people had all the newest notions. One of his\\nuncles always walked about without a hat, and another had made an\\nunsuccessful attempt to walk about with a hat and nothing else. His\\nfather cultivated art and self-realisation; his mother went in for\\nsimplicity and hygiene. Hence the child, during his tenderer years,\\nwas wholly unacquainted with any drink between the extremes of\\nabsinth and cocoa, of both of which he had a healthy dislike. The\\nmore his mother preached a more than Puritan abstinence the more\\ndid his father expand into a more than pagan latitude; and by the\\ntime the former had come to enforcing vegetarianism, the latter had\\npretty well reached the point of defending cannibalism.\\n\\nBeing surrounded with every conceivable kind of revolt from\\ninfancy, Gabriel had to revolt into something, so he revolted into\\nthe only thing left--sanity. But there was just enough in him of\\nthe blood of these fanatics to make even his protest for common\\nsense a little too fierce to be sensible. His hatred of modern\\nlawlessness had been crowned also by an accident. It happened that\\nhe was walking in a side street at the instant of a dynamite\\noutrage. He had been blind and deaf for a moment, and then seen,\\nthe smoke clearing, the broken windows and the bleeding faces.\\nAfter that he went about as usual--quiet, courteous, rather gentle;\\nbut there was a spot on his mind that was not sane. He did not\\nregard anarchists, as most of us do, as a handful of morbid men,\\ncombining ignorance with intellectualism. He regarded them as a\\nhuge and pitiless peril, like a Chinese invasion.\\n\\nHe poured perpetually into newspapers and their waste-paper baskets\\na torrent of tales, verses and violent articles, warning men of\\nthis deluge of barbaric denial. But he seemed to be getting no\\nnearer his enemy, and, what was worse, no nearer a living. As he\\npaced the Thames embankment, bitterly biting a cheap cigar and\\nbrooding on the advance of Anarchy, there was no anarchist with\\na bomb in his pocket so savage or so solitary as he. Indeed, he\\nalways felt that Government stood alone and desperate, with its\\nback to the wall. He was too quixotic to have cared for it\\notherwise.\\n\\nHe walked on the Embankment once under a dark red sunset. The red\\nriver reflected the red sky, and they both reflected his anger. The\\nsky, indeed, was so swarthy, and the light on the river relatively\\nso lurid, that the water almost seemed of fiercer flame than the\\nsunset it mirrored. It looked like a stream of literal fire winding\\nunder the vast caverns of a subterranean country.\\n\\nSyme was shabby in those days. He wore an old-fashioned black\\nchimney-pot hat; he was wrapped in a yet more old-fashioned cloak,\\nblack and ragged; and the combination gave him the look of the\\nearly villains in Dickens and Bulwer Lytton. Also his yellow beard\\nand hair were more unkempt and leonine than when they appeared long\\nafterwards, cut and pointed, on the lawns of Saffron Park. A long,\\nlean, black cigar, bought in Soho for twopence, stood out from\\nbetween his tightened teeth, and altogether he looked a very\\nsatisfactory specimen of the anarchists upon whom he had vowed a\\nholy war. Perhaps this was why a policeman on the Embankment spoke\\nto him, and said \"Good evening.\"\\n\\nSyme, at a crisis of his morbid fears for humanity, seemed stung by\\nthe mere stolidity of the automatic official, a mere bulk of blue\\nin the twilight.\\n\\n\"A good evening is it?\" he said sharply. \"You fellows would call\\nthe end of the world a good evening. Look at that bloody red sun\\nand that bloody river! I tell you that if that were literally human\\nblood, spilt and shining, you would still be standing here as solid\\nas ever, looking out for some poor harmless tramp whom you could\\nmove on. You policemen are cruel to the poor, but I could forgive\\nyou even your cruelty if it were not for your calm.\"\\n\\n\"If we are calm,\" replied the policeman, \"it is the calm of\\norganised resistance.\"\\n\\n\"Eh?\" said Syme, staring.\\n\\n\"The soldier must be calm in the thick of the battle,\" pursued the\\npoliceman. \"The composure of an army is the anger of a nation.\"\\n\\n\"Good God, the Board Schools!\" said Syme. \"Is this undenominational\\neducation?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said the policeman sadly, \"I never had any of those\\nadvantages. The Board Schools came after my time. What education\\nI had was very rough and old-fashioned, I am afraid.\"\\n\\n\"Where did you have it?\" asked Syme, wondering.\\n\\n\"Oh, at Harrow,\" said the policeman\\n\\nThe class sympathies which, false as they are, are the truest\\nthings in so many men, broke out of Syme before he could control\\nthem.\\n\\n\"But, good Lord, man,\" he said, \"you oughtn\\'t to be a policeman!\"\\n\\nThe policeman sighed and shook his head.\\n\\n\"I know,\" he said solemnly, \"I know I am not worthy.\"\\n\\n\"But why did you join the police?\" asked Syme with rude curiosity.\\n\\n\"For much the same reason that you abused the police,\" replied the\\nother. \"I found that there was a special opening in the service for\\nthose whose fears for humanity were concerned rather with the\\naberrations of the scientific intellect than with the normal and\\nexcusable, though excessive, outbreaks of the human will. I trust\\nI make myself clear.\"\\n\\n\"If you mean that you make your opinion clear,\" said Syme, \"I\\nsuppose you do. But as for making yourself clear, it is the last\\nthing you do. How comes a man like you to be talking philosophy\\nin a blue helmet on the Thames embankment?\\n\\n\"You have evidently not heard of the latest development in our\\npolice system,\" replied the other. \"I am not surprised at it. We\\nare keeping it rather dark from the educated class, because that\\nclass contains most of our enemies. But you seem to be exactly in\\nthe right frame of mind. I think you might almost join us.\"\\n\\n\"Join you in what?\" asked Syme.\\n\\n\"I will tell you,\" said the policeman slowly. \"This is the\\nsituation: The head of one of our departments, one of the most\\ncelebrated detectives in Europe, has long been of opinion that a\\npurely intellectual conspiracy would soon threaten the very\\nexistence of civilisation. He is certain that the scientific and\\nartistic worlds are silently bound in a crusade against the Family\\nand the State. He has, therefore, formed a special corps of\\npolicemen, policemen who are also philosophers. It is their\\nbusiness to watch the beginnings of this conspiracy, not merely in\\na criminal but in a controversial sense. I am a democrat myself,\\nand I am fully aware of the value of the ordinary man in matters of\\nordinary valour or virtue. But it would obviously be undesirable to\\nemploy the common policeman in an investigation which is also a\\nheresy hunt.\"\\n\\nSyme\\'s eyes were bright with a sympathetic curiosity.\\n\\n\"What do you do, then?\" he said.\\n\\n\"The work of the philosophical policeman,\" replied the man in\\nblue, \"is at once bolder and more subtle than that of the ordinary\\ndetective. The ordinary detective goes to pot-houses to arrest\\nthieves; we go to artistic tea-parties to detect pessimists. The\\nordinary detective discovers from a ledger or a diary that a crime\\nhas been committed. We discover from a book of sonnets that a crime\\nwill be committed. We have to trace the origin of those dreadful\\nthoughts that drive men on at last to intellectual fanaticism and\\nintellectual crime. We were only just in time to prevent the\\nassassination at Hartle pool, and that was entirely due to the fact\\nthat our Mr. Wilks (a smart young fellow) thoroughly understood a\\ntriolet.\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean,\" asked Syme, \"that there is really as much connection\\nbetween crime and the modern intellect as all that?\"\\n\\n\"You are not sufficiently democratic,\" answered the policeman, \"but\\nyou were right when you said just now that our ordinary treatment\\nof the poor criminal was a pretty brutal business. I tell you I am\\nsometimes sick of my trade when I see how perpetually it means\\nmerely a war upon the ignorant and the desperate. But this new\\nmovement of ours is a very different affair. We deny the snobbish\\nEnglish assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous criminals.\\nWe remember the Roman Emperors. We remember the great poisoning\\nprinces of the Renaissance. We say that the dangerous criminal is\\nthe educated criminal. We say that the most dangerous criminal now\\nis the entirely lawless modern philosopher. Compared to him,\\nburglars and bigamists are essentially moral men; my heart goes out\\nto them. They accept the essential ideal of man; they merely seek\\nit wrongly. Thieves respect property. They merely wish the property\\nto become their property that they may more perfectly respect it.\\nBut philosophers dislike property as property; they wish to destroy\\nthe very idea of personal possession. Bigamists respect marriage,\\nor they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even\\nritualistic formality of bigamy. But philosophers despise marriage\\nas marriage. Murderers respect human life; they merely wish to\\nattain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the\\nsacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives. But\\nphilosophers hate life itself, their own as much as other\\npeople\\'s.\"\\n\\nSyme struck his hands together.\\n\\n\"How true that is,\" he cried. \"I have felt it from my boyhood, but\\nnever could state the verbal antithesis. The common criminal is a\\nbad man, but at least he is, as it were, a conditional good man.\\nHe says that if only a certain obstacle be removed--say a wealthy\\nuncle--he is then prepared to accept the universe and to praise\\nGod. He is a reformer, but not an anarchist. He wishes to cleanse\\nthe edifice, but not to destroy it. But the evil philosopher is\\nnot trying to alter things, but to annihilate them. Yes, the\\nmodern world has retained all those parts of police work which are\\nreally oppressive and ignominious, the harrying of the poor, the\\nspying upon the unfortunate. It has given up its more dignified\\nwork, the punishment of powerful traitors the in the State and\\npowerful heresiarchs in the Church. The moderns say we must not\\npunish heretics. My only doubt is whether we have a right to\\npunish anybody else.\"\\n\\n\"But this is absurd!\" cried the policeman, clasping his hands with\\nan excitement uncommon in persons of his figure and costume, \"but\\nit is intolerable! I don\\'t know what you\\'re doing, but you\\'re\\nwasting your life. You must, you shall, join our special army\\nagainst anarchy. Their armies are on our frontiers. Their bolt\\nis ready to fall. A moment more, and you may lose the glory of\\nworking with us, perhaps the glory of dying with the last heroes\\nof the world.\"\\n\\n\"It is a chance not to be missed, certainly,\" assented Syme, \"but\\nstill I do not quite understand. I know as well as anybody that\\nthe modern world is full of lawless little men and mad little\\nmovements. But, beastly as they are, they generally have the one\\nmerit of disagreeing with each other. How can you talk of their\\nleading one army or hurling one bolt. What is this anarchy?\"\\n\\n\"Do not confuse it,\" replied the constable, \"with those chance\\ndynamite outbreaks from Russia or from Ireland, which are really\\nthe outbreaks of oppressed, if mistaken, men. This is a vast\\nphilosophic movement, consisting of an outer and an inner ring.\\nYou might even call the outer ring the laity and the inner ring\\nthe priesthood. I prefer to call the outer ring the innocent\\nsection, the inner ring the supremely guilty section. The outer\\nring--the main mass of their supporters--are merely anarchists;\\nthat is, men who believe that rules and formulas have destroyed\\nhuman happiness. They believe that all the evil results of human\\ncrime are the results of the system that has called it crime. They\\ndo not believe that the crime creates the punishment. They believe\\nthat the punishment has created the crime. They believe that if a\\nman seduced seven women he would naturally walk away as blameless\\nas the flowers of spring. They believe that if a man picked a\\npocket he would naturally feel exquisitely good. These I call the\\ninnocent section.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said Syme.\\n\\n\"Naturally, therefore, these people talk about \\'a happy time\\ncoming\\'; \\'the paradise of the future\\'; \\'mankind freed from the\\nbondage of vice and the bondage of virtue,\\' and so on. And so also\\nthe men of the inner circle speak--the sacred priesthood. They\\nalso speak to applauding crowds of the happiness of the future,\\nand of mankind freed at last. But in their mouths\"--and the\\npoliceman lowered his voice--\"in their mouths these happy phrases\\nhave a horrible meaning. They are under no illusions; they are too\\nintellectual to think that man upon this earth can ever be quite\\nfree of original sin and the struggle. And they mean death. When\\nthey say that mankind shall be free at last, they mean that\\nmankind shall commit suicide. When they talk of a paradise without\\nright or wrong, they mean the grave.\\n\\nThey have but two objects, to destroy first humanity and then\\nthemselves. That is why they throw bombs instead of firing pistols.\\nThe innocent rank and file are disappointed because the bomb has\\nnot killed the king; but the high-priesthood are happy because it\\nhas killed somebody.\"\\n\\n\"How can I join you?\" asked Syme, with a sort of passion.\\n\\n\"I know for a fact that there is a vacancy at the moment,\" said the\\npoliceman, \"as I have the honour to be somewhat in the confidence\\nof the chief of whom I have spoken. You should really come and see\\nhim. Or rather, I should not say see him, nobody ever sees him; but\\nyou can talk to him if you like.\"\\n\\n\"Telephone?\" inquired Syme, with interest.\\n\\n\"No,\" said the policeman placidly, \"he has a fancy for always\\nsitting in a pitch-dark room. He says it makes his thoughts\\nbrighter. Do come along.\"\\n\\nSomewhat dazed and considerably excited, Syme allowed himself to be\\nled to a side-door in the long row of buildings of Scotland Yard.\\nAlmost before he knew what he was doing, he had been passed through\\nthe hands of about four intermediate officials, and was suddenly\\nshown into a room, the abrupt blackness of which startled him like\\na blaze of light. It was not the ordinary darkness, in which forms\\ncan be faintly traced; it was like going suddenly stone-blind.\\n\\n\"Are you the new recruit?\" asked a heavy voice.\\n\\nAnd in some strange way, though there was not the shadow of a shape\\nin the gloom, Syme knew two things: first, that it came from a man\\nof massive stature; and second, that the man had his back to him.\\n\\n\"Are you the new recruit?\" said the invisible chief, who seemed to\\nhave heard all about it. \"All right. You are engaged.\"\\n\\nSyme, quite swept off his feet, made a feeble fight against this\\nirrevocable phrase.\\n\\n\"I really have no experience,\" he began.\\n\\n\"No one has any experience,\" said the other, \"of the Battle of\\nArmageddon.\"\\n\\n\"But I am really unfit--\"\\n\\n\"You are willing, that is enough,\" said the unknown.\\n\\n\"Well, really,\" said Syme, \"I don\\'t know any profession of which\\nmere willingness is the final test.\"\\n\\n\"I do,\" said the other--\"martyrs. I am condemning you to death.\\nGood day.\"\\n\\nThus it was that when Gabriel Syme came out again into the crimson\\nlight of evening, in his shabby black hat and shabby, lawless\\ncloak, he came out a member of the New Detective Corps for the\\nfrustration of the great conspiracy. Acting under the advice of his\\nfriend the policeman (who was professionally inclined to neatness),\\nhe trimmed his hair and beard, bought a good hat, clad himself in\\nan exquisite summer suit of light blue-grey, with a pale yellow\\nflower in the button-hole, and, in short, became that elegant and\\nrather insupportable person whom Gregory had first encountered in\\nthe little garden of Saffron Park. Before he finally left the\\npolice premises his friend provided him with a small blue card,\\non which was written, \"The Last Crusade,\" and a number, the sign\\nof his official authority. He put this carefully in his upper\\nwaistcoat pocket, lit a cigarette, and went forth to track and\\nfight the enemy in all the drawing-rooms of London. Where his\\nadventure ultimately led him we have already seen. At about\\nhalf-past one on a February night he found himself steaming in a\\nsmall tug up the silent Thames, armed with swordstick and revolver,\\nthe duly elected Thursday of the Central Council of Anarchists.\\n\\nWhen Syme stepped out on to the steam-tug he had a singular\\nsensation of stepping out into something entirely new; not merely\\ninto the landscape of a new land, but even into the landscape of a\\nnew planet. This was mainly due to the insane yet solid decision of\\nthat evening, though partly also to an entire change in the weather\\nand the sky since he entered the little tavern some two hours\\nbefore. Every trace of the passionate plumage of the cloudy sunset\\nhad been swept away, and a naked moon stood in a naked sky. The\\nmoon was so strong and full that (by a paradox often to be noticed)\\nit seemed like a weaker sun. It gave, not the sense of bright\\nmoonshine, but rather of a dead daylight.\\n\\nOver the whole landscape lay a luminous and unnatural\\ndiscoloration, as of that disastrous twilight which Milton spoke\\nof as shed by the sun in eclipse; so that Syme fell easily into\\nhis first thought, that he was actually on some other and emptier\\nplanet, which circled round some sadder star. But the more he felt\\nthis glittering desolation in the moonlit land, the more his own\\nchivalric folly glowed in the night like a great fire. Even the\\ncommon things he carried with him--the food and the brandy and the\\nloaded pistol--took on exactly that concrete and material poetry\\nwhich a child feels when he takes a gun upon a journey or a bun\\nwith him to bed. The sword-stick and the brandy-flask, though in\\nthemselves only the tools of morbid conspirators, became the\\nexpressions of his own more healthy romance. The sword-stick\\nbecame almost the sword of chivalry, and the brandy the wine of\\nthe stirrup-cup. For even the most dehumanised modern fantasies\\ndepend on some older and simpler figure; the adventures may be\\nmad, but the adventurer must be sane. The dragon without St.\\nGeorge would not even be grotesque. So this inhuman landscape was\\nonly imaginative by the presence of a man really human. To Syme\\'s\\nexaggerative mind the bright, bleak houses and terraces by the\\nThames looked as empty as the mountains of the moon. But even the\\nmoon is only poetical because there is a man in the moon.\\n\\nThe tug was worked by two men, and with much toil went\\ncomparatively slowly. The clear moon that had lit up Chiswick had\\ngone down by the time that they passed Battersea, and when they\\ncame under the enormous bulk of Westminster day had already begun\\nto break. It broke like the splitting of great bars of lead,\\nshowing bars of silver; and these had brightened like white fire\\nwhen the tug, changing its onward course, turned inward to a large\\nlanding stage rather beyond Charing Cross.\\n\\nThe great stones of the Embankment seemed equally dark and gigantic\\nas Syme looked up at them. They were big and black against the huge\\nwhite dawn. They made him feel that he was landing on the colossal\\nsteps of some Egyptian palace; and, indeed, the thing suited his\\nmood, for he was, in his own mind, mounting to attack the solid\\nthrones of horrible and heathen kings. He leapt out of the boat on\\nto one slimy step, and stood, a dark and slender figure, amid the\\nenormous masonry. The two men in the tug put her off again and\\nturned up stream. They had never spoken a word.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nTHE FEAST OF FEAR\\n\\nAT first the large stone stair seemed to Syme as deserted as a\\npyramid; but before he reached the top he had realised that there\\nwas a man leaning over the parapet of the Embankment and looking\\nout across the river. As a figure he was quite conventional, clad\\nin a silk hat and frock-coat of the more formal type of fashion;\\nhe had a red flower in his buttonhole. As Syme drew nearer to him\\nstep by step, he did not even move a hair; and Syme could come\\nclose enough to notice even in the dim, pale morning light that\\nhis face was long, pale and intellectual, and ended in a small\\ntriangular tuft of dark beard at the very point of the chin, all\\nelse being clean-shaven. This scrap of hair almost seemed a mere\\noversight; the rest of the face was of the type that is best\\nshaven--clear-cut, ascetic, and in its way noble. Syme drew closer\\nand closer, noting all this, and still the figure did not stir.\\n\\nAt first an instinct had told Syme that this was the man whom he\\nwas meant to meet. Then, seeing that the man made no sign, he had\\nconcluded that he was not. And now again he had come back to a\\ncertainty that the man had something to do with his mad adventure.\\nFor the man remained more still than would have been natural if a\\nstranger had come so close. He was as motionless as a wax-work,\\nand got on the nerves somewhat in the same way. Syme looked again\\nand again at the pale, dignified and delicate face, and the face\\nstill looked blankly across the river. Then he took out of his\\npocket the note from Buttons proving his election, and put it\\nbefore that sad and beautiful face. Then the man smiled, and his\\nsmile was a shock, for it was all on one side, going up in the\\nright cheek and down in the left.\\n\\nThere was nothing, rationally speaking, to scare anyone about\\nthis. Many people have this nervous trick of a crooked smile, and\\nin many it is even attractive. But in all Syme\\'s circumstances,\\nwith the dark dawn and the deadly errand and the loneliness on the\\ngreat dripping stones, there was something unnerving in it.\\n\\nThere was the silent river and the silent man, a man of even\\nclassic face. And there was the last nightmare touch that his\\nsmile suddenly went wrong.\\n\\nThe spasm of smile was instantaneous, and the man\\'s face dropped\\nat once into its harmonious melancholy. He spoke without further\\nexplanation or inquiry, like a man speaking to an old colleague.\\n\\n\"If we walk up towards Leicester Square,\" he said, \"we shall just\\nbe in time for breakfast. Sunday always insists on an early\\nbreakfast. Have you had any sleep?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Syme.\\n\\n\"Nor have I,\" answered the man in an ordinary tone. \"I shall try to\\nget to bed after breakfast.\"\\n\\nHe spoke with casual civility, but in an utterly dead voice that\\ncontradicted the fanaticism of his face. It seemed almost as if all\\nfriendly words were to him lifeless conveniences, and that his only\\nlife was hate. After a pause the man spoke again.\\n\\n\"Of course, the Secretary of the branch told you everything that\\ncan be told. But the one thing that can never be told is the last\\nnotion of the President, for his notions grow like a tropical\\nforest. So in case you don\\'t know, I\\'d better tell you that he is\\ncarrying out his notion of concealing ourselves by not concealing\\nourselves to the most extraordinary lengths just now. Originally,\\nof course, we met in a cell underground, just as your branch does.\\nThen Sunday made us take a private room at an ordinary restaurant.\\nHe said that if you didn\\'t seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out.\\nWell, he is the only man on earth, I know; but sometimes I really\\nthink that his huge brain is going a little mad in its old age. For\\nnow we flaunt ourselves before the public. We have our breakfast on\\na balcony--on a balcony, if you please--overlooking Leicester\\nSquare.\"\\n\\n\"And what do the people say?\" asked Syme.\\n\\n\"It\\'s quite simple what they say,\" answered his guide.\\n\\n\"They say we are a lot of jolly gentlemen who pretend they are\\nanarchists.\"\\n\\n\"It seems to me a very clever idea,\" said Syme.\\n\\n\"Clever! God blast your impudence! Clever!\" cried out the other in\\na sudden, shrill voice which was as startling and discordant as his\\ncrooked smile. \"When you\\'ve seen Sunday for a split second you\\'ll\\nleave off calling him clever.\"\\n\\nWith this they emerged out of a narrow street, and saw the early\\nsunlight filling Leicester Square. It will never be known, I\\nsuppose, why this square itself should look so alien and in some\\nways so continental. It will never be known whether it was the\\nforeign look that attracted the foreigners or the foreigners who\\ngave it the foreign look. But on this particular morning the effect\\nseemed singularly bright and clear. Between the open square and the\\nsunlit leaves and the statue and the Saracenic outlines of the\\nAlhambra, it looked the replica of some French or even Spanish\\npublic place. And this effect increased in Syme the sensation,\\nwhich in many shapes he had had through the whole adventure, the\\neerie sensation of having strayed into a new world. As a fact, he\\nhad bought bad cigars round Leicester Square ever since he was a\\nboy. But as he turned that corner, and saw the trees and the\\nMoorish cupolas, he could have sworn that he was turning into an\\nunknown Place de something or other in some foreign town.\\n\\nAt one corner of the square there projected a kind of angle of a\\nprosperous but quiet hotel, the bulk of which belonged to a street\\nbehind. In the wall there was one large French window, probably\\nthe window of a large coffee-room; and outside this window, almost\\nliterally overhanging the square, was a formidably buttressed\\nbalcony, big enough to contain a dining-table. In fact, it did\\ncontain a dining-table, or more strictly a breakfast-table; and\\nround the breakfast-table, glowing in the sunlight and evident to\\nthe street, were a group of noisy and talkative men, all dressed\\nin the insolence of fashion, with white waistcoats and expensive\\nbutton-holes. Some of their jokes could almost be heard across the\\nsquare. Then the grave Secretary gave his unnatural smile, and Syme\\nknew that this boisterous breakfast party was the secret conclave\\nof the European Dynamiters.\\n\\nThen, as Syme continued to stare at them, he saw something that he\\nhad not seen before. He had not seen it literally because it was\\ntoo large to see. At the nearest end of the balcony, blocking up a\\ngreat part of the perspective, was the back of a great mountain of\\na man. When Syme had seen him, his first thought was that the\\nweight of him must break down the balcony of stone. His vastness\\ndid not lie only in the fact that he was abnormally tall and quite\\nincredibly fat. This man was planned enormously in his original\\nproportions, like a statue carved deliberately as colossal. His\\nhead, crowned with white hair, as seen from behind looked bigger\\nthan a head ought to be. The ears that stood out from it looked\\nlarger than human ears. He was enlarged terribly to scale; and this\\nsense of size was so staggering, that when Syme saw him all the\\nother figures seemed quite suddenly to dwindle and become dwarfish.\\nThey were still sitting there as before with their flowers and\\nfrock-coats, but now it looked as if the big man was entertaining\\nfive children to tea.\\n\\nAs Syme and the guide approached the side door of the hotel, a\\nwaiter came out smiling with every tooth in his head.\\n\\n\"The gentlemen are up there, sare,\" he said. \"They do talk and they\\ndo laugh at what they talk. They do say they will throw bombs at ze\\nking.\"\\n\\nAnd the waiter hurried away with a napkin over his arm, much\\npleased with the singular frivolity of the gentlemen upstairs.\\n\\nThe two men mounted the stairs in silence.\\n\\nSyme had never thought of asking whether the monstrous man who\\nalmost filled and broke the balcony was the great President of whom\\nthe others stood in awe. He knew it was so, with an unaccountable\\nbut instantaneous certainty. Syme, indeed, was one of those men who\\nare open to all the more nameless psychological influences in a\\ndegree a little dangerous to mental health. Utterly devoid of fear\\nin physical dangers, he was a great deal too sensitive to the smell\\nof spiritual evil. Twice already that night little unmeaning things\\nhad peeped out at him almost pruriently, and given him a sense of\\ndrawing nearer and nearer to the head-quarters of hell. And this\\nsense became overpowering as he drew nearer to the great President.\\n\\nThe form it took was a childish and yet hateful fancy. As he walked\\nacross the inner room towards the balcony, the large face of Sunday\\ngrew larger and larger; and Syme was gripped with a fear that when\\nhe was quite close the face would be too big to be possible, and\\nthat he would scream aloud. He remembered that as a child he would\\nnot look at the mask of Memnon in the British Museum, because it\\nwas a face, and so large.\\n\\nBy an effort, braver than that of leaping over a cliff, he went to\\nan empty seat at the breakfast-table and sat down. The men greeted\\nhim with good-humoured raillery as if they had always known him. He\\nsobered himself a little by looking at their conventional coats and\\nsolid, shining coffee-pot; then he looked again at Sunday. His face\\nwas very large, but it was still possible to humanity.\\n\\nIn the presence of the President the whole company looked\\nsufficiently commonplace; nothing about them caught the eye at\\nfirst, except that by the President\\'s caprice they had been dressed\\nup with a festive respectability, which gave the meal the look of a\\nwedding breakfast. One man indeed stood out at even a superficial\\nglance. He at least was the common or garden Dynamiter. He wore,\\nindeed, the high white collar and satin tie that were the uniform\\nof the occasion; but out of this collar there sprang a head quite\\nunmanageable and quite unmistakable, a bewildering bush of brown\\nhair and beard that almost obscured the eyes like those of a Skye\\nterrier. But the eyes did look out of the tangle, and they were the\\nsad eyes of some Russian serf. The effect of this figure was not\\nterrible like that of the President, but it had every diablerie\\nthat can come from the utterly grotesque. If out of that stiff tie\\nand collar there had come abruptly the head of a cat or a dog, it\\ncould not have been a more idiotic contrast.\\n\\nThe man\\'s name, it seemed, was Gogol; he was a Pole, and in this\\ncircle of days he was called Tuesday. His soul and speech were\\nincurably tragic; he could not force himself to play the\\nprosperous and frivolous part demanded of him by President Sunday.\\nAnd, indeed, when Syme came in the President, with that daring\\ndisregard of public suspicion which was his policy, was actually\\nchaffing Gogol upon his inability to assume conventional graces.\\n\\n\"Our friend Tuesday,\" said the President in a deep voice at once\\nof quietude and volume, \"our friend Tuesday doesn\\'t seem to grasp\\nthe idea. He dresses up like a gentleman, but he seems to be too\\ngreat a soul to behave like one. He insists on the ways of the\\nstage conspirator. Now if a gentleman goes about London in a top\\nhat and a frock-coat, no one need know that he is an anarchist.\\nBut if a gentleman puts on a top hat and a frock-coat, and then\\ngoes about on his hands and knees--well, he may attract attention.\\nThat\\'s what Brother Gogol does. He goes about on his hands and\\nknees with such inexhaustible diplomacy, that by this time he\\nfinds it quite difficult to walk upright.\"\\n\\n\"I am not good at goncealment,\" said Gogol sulkily, with a thick\\nforeign accent; \"I am not ashamed of the cause.\"\\n\\n\"Yes you are, my boy, and so is the cause of you,\" said the\\nPresident good-naturedly. \"You hide as much as anybody; but you\\ncan\\'t do it, you see, you\\'re such an ass! You try to combine two\\ninconsistent methods. When a householder finds a man under his\\nbed, he will probably pause to note the circumstance. But if he\\nfinds a man under his bed in a top hat, you will agree with me, \\nmy dear Tuesday, that he is not likely even to forget it. Now\\nwhen you were found under Admiral Biffin\\'s bed--\"\\n\\n\"I am not good at deception,\" said Tuesday gloomily, flushing.\\n\\n\"Right, my boy, right,\" said the President with a ponderous\\nheartiness, \"you aren\\'t good at anything.\"\\n\\nWhile this stream of conversation continued, Syme was looking\\nmore steadily at the men around him. As he did so, he gradually\\nfelt all his sense of something spiritually queer return.\\n\\nHe had thought at first that they were all of common stature and\\ncostume, with the evident exception of the hairy Gogol. But as he\\nlooked at the others, he began to see in each of them exactly what\\nhe had seen in the man by the river, a demoniac detail somewhere.\\nThat lop-sided laugh, which would suddenly disfigure the fine\\nface of his original guide, was typical of all these types. Each\\nman had something about him, perceived perhaps at the tenth or\\ntwentieth glance, which was not normal, and which seemed hardly\\nhuman. The only metaphor he could think of was this, that they\\nall looked as men of fashion and presence would look, with the\\nadditional twist given in a false and curved mirror.\\n\\nOnly the individual examples will express this half-concealed\\neccentricity. Syme\\'s original cicerone bore the title of Monday;\\nhe was the Secretary of the Council, and his twisted smile was\\nregarded with more terror than anything, except the President\\'s\\nhorrible, happy laughter. But now that Syme had more space and\\nlight to observe him, there were other touches. His fine face\\nwas so emaciated, that Syme thought it must be wasted with some\\ndisease; yet somehow the very distress of his dark eyes denied\\nthis. It was no physical ill that troubled him. His eyes were\\nalive with intellectual torture, as if pure thought was pain.\\n\\nHe was typical of each of the tribe; each man was subtly and\\ndifferently wrong. Next to him sat Tuesday, the tousle-headed\\nGogol, a man more obviously mad. Next was Wednesday, a certain\\nMarquis de St. Eustache, a sufficiently characteristic figure. The\\nfirst few glances found nothing unusual about him, except that he\\nwas the only man at table who wore the fashionable clothes as if\\nthey were really his own. He had a black French beard cut square\\nand a black English frock-coat cut even squarer. But Syme,\\nsensitive to such things, felt somehow that the man carried a rich\\natmosphere with him, a rich atmosphere that suffocated. It\\nreminded one irrationally of drowsy odours and of dying lamps in\\nthe darker poems of Byron and Poe. With this went a sense of his\\nbeing clad, not in lighter colours, but in softer materials; his\\nblack seemed richer and warmer than the black shades about him, as\\nif it were compounded of profound colour. His black coat looked as\\nif it were only black by being too dense a purple. His black beard\\nlooked as if it were only black by being too deep a blue. And in\\nthe gloom and thickness of the beard his dark red mouth showed\\nsensual and scornful. Whatever he was he was not a Frenchman; he\\nmight be a Jew; he might be something deeper yet in the dark heart\\nof the East. In the bright coloured Persian tiles and pictures\\nshowing tyrants hunting, you may see just those almond eyes, those\\nblue-black beards, those cruel, crimson lips.\\n\\nThen came Syme, and next a very old man, Professor de Worms, who\\nstill kept the chair of Friday, though every day it was expected\\nthat his death would leave it empty. Save for his intellect, he was\\nin the last dissolution of senile decay. His face was as grey as\\nhis long grey beard, his forehead was lifted and fixed finally in a\\nfurrow of mild despair. In no other case, not even that of Gogol,\\ndid the bridegroom brilliancy of the morning dress express a more\\npainful contrast. For the red flower in his button-hole showed up\\nagainst a face that was literally discoloured like lead; the whole\\nhideous effect was as if some drunken dandies had put their clothes\\nupon a corpse. When he rose or sat down, which was with long labour\\nand peril, something worse was expressed than mere weakness,\\nsomething indefinably connected with the horror of the whole scene.\\nIt did not express decrepitude merely, but corruption. Another\\nhateful fancy crossed Syme\\'s quivering mind. He could not help\\nthinking that whenever the man moved a leg or arm might fall off.\\n\\nRight at the end sat the man called Saturday, the simplest and the\\nmost baffling of all. He was a short, square man with a dark,\\nsquare face clean-shaven, a medical practitioner going by the name\\nof Bull. He had that combination of savoir-faire with a sort of\\nwell-groomed coarseness which is not uncommon in young doctors. He\\ncarried his fine clothes with confidence rather than ease, and he\\nmostly wore a set smile. There was nothing whatever odd about him,\\nexcept that he wore a pair of dark, almost opaque spectacles. It\\nmay have been merely a crescendo of nervous fancy that had gone\\nbefore, but those black discs were dreadful to Syme; they reminded\\nhim of half-remembered ugly tales, of some story about pennies\\nbeing put on the eyes of the dead. Syme\\'s eye always caught the\\nblack glasses and the blind grin. Had the dying Professor worn\\nthem, or even the pale Secretary, they would have been appropriate.\\nBut on the younger and grosser man they seemed only an enigma. They\\ntook away the key of the face. You could not tell what his smile or\\nhis gravity meant. Partly from this, and partly because he had a\\nvulgar virility wanting in most of the others it seemed to Syme\\nthat he might be the wickedest of all those wicked men. Syme even\\nhad the thought that his eyes might be covered up because they were\\ntoo frightful to see.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nTHE EXPOSURE\\n\\nSUCH were the six men who had sworn to destroy the world. Again\\nand again Syme strove to pull together his common sense in their\\npresence. Sometimes he saw for an instant that these notions were\\nsubjective, that he was only looking at ordinary men, one of whom\\nwas old, another nervous, another short-sighted. The sense of an\\nunnatural symbolism always settled back on him again. Each figure\\nseemed to be, somehow, on the borderland of things, just as their\\ntheory was on the borderland of thought. He knew that each one of\\nthese men stood at the extreme end, so to speak, of some wild road\\nof reasoning. He could only fancy, as in some old-world fable,\\nthat if a man went westward to the end of the world he would find\\nsomething--say a tree--that was more or less than a tree, a tree\\npossessed by a spirit; and that if he went east to the end of the\\nworld he would find something else that was not wholly itself--a\\ntower, perhaps, of which the very shape was wicked. So these\\nfigures seemed to stand up, violent and unaccountable, against an\\nultimate horizon, visions from the verge. The ends of the earth\\nwere closing in.\\n\\nTalk had been going on steadily as he took in the scene; and not\\nthe least of the contrasts of that bewildering breakfast-table was\\nthe contrast between the easy and unobtrusive tone of talk and its\\nterrible purport. They were deep in the discussion of an actual and\\nimmediate plot. The waiter downstairs had spoken quite correctly\\nwhen he said that they were talking about bombs and kings. Only\\nthree days afterwards the Czar was to meet the President of the\\nFrench Republic in Paris, and over their bacon and eggs upon their\\nsunny balcony these beaming gentlemen had decided how both should\\ndie. Even the instrument was chosen; the black-bearded Marquis, it\\nappeared, was to carry the bomb.\\n\\nOrdinarily speaking, the proximity of this positive and objective\\ncrime would have sobered Syme, and cured him of all his merely\\nmystical tremors. He would have thought of nothing but the need of\\nsaving at least two human bodies from being ripped in pieces with\\niron and roaring gas. But the truth was that by this time he had\\nbegun to feel a third kind of fear, more piercing and practical\\nthan either his moral revulsion or his social responsibility. Very\\nsimply, he had no fear to spare for the French President or the\\nCzar; he had begun to fear for himself. Most of the talkers took\\nlittle heed of him, debating now with their faces closer together,\\nand almost uniformly grave, save when for an instant the smile of\\nthe Secretary ran aslant across his face as the jagged lightning\\nruns aslant across the sky. But there was one persistent thing\\nwhich first troubled Syme and at last terrified him. The President\\nwas always looking at him, steadily, and with a great and baffling\\ninterest. The enormous man was quite quiet, but his blue eyes\\nstood out of his head. And they were always fixed on Syme.\\n\\nSyme felt moved to spring up and leap over the balcony. When the\\nPresident\\'s eyes were on him he felt as if he were made of glass.\\nHe had hardly the shred of a doubt that in some silent and\\nextraordinary way Sunday had found out that he was a spy. He\\nlooked over the edge of the balcony, and saw a policeman, standing\\nabstractedly just beneath, staring at the bright railings and the\\nsunlit trees.\\n\\nThen there fell upon him the great temptation that was to torment\\nhim for many days. In the presence of these powerful and repulsive\\nmen, who were the princes of anarchy, he had almost forgotten the\\nfrail and fanciful figure of the poet Gregory, the mere aesthete of\\nanarchism. He even thought of him now with an old kindness, as if\\nthey had played together when children. But he remembered that he\\nwas still tied to Gregory by a great promise. He had promised never\\nto do the very thing that he now felt himself almost in the act of\\ndoing. He had promised not to jump over that balcony and speak to\\nthat policeman. He took his cold hand off the cold stone\\nbalustrade. His soul swayed in a vertigo of moral indecision. He\\nhad only to snap the thread of a rash vow made to a villainous\\nsociety, and all his life could be as open and sunny as the square\\nbeneath him. He had, on the other hand, only to keep his antiquated\\nhonour, and be delivered inch by inch into the power of this great\\nenemy of mankind, whose very intellect was a torture-chamber.\\nWhenever he looked down into the square he saw the comfortable\\npoliceman, a pillar of common sense and common order. Whenever he\\nlooked back at the breakfast-table he saw the President still\\nquietly studying him with big, unbearable eyes.\\n\\nIn all the torrent of his thought there were two thoughts that\\nnever crossed his mind. First, it never occurred to him to doubt\\nthat the President and his Council could crush him if he continued\\nto stand alone. The place might be public, the project might seem\\nimpossible. But Sunday was not the man who would carry himself\\nthus easily without having, somehow or somewhere, set open his\\niron trap. Either by anonymous poison or sudden street accident,\\nby hypnotism or by fire from hell, Sunday could certainly strike\\nhim. If he defied the man he was probably dead, either struck\\nstiff there in his chair or long afterwards as by an innocent\\nailment. If he called in the police promptly, arrested everyone,\\ntold all, and set against them the whole energy of England, he\\nwould probably escape; certainly not otherwise. They were a\\nbalconyful of gentlemen overlooking a bright and busy square; but\\nhe felt no more safe with them than if they had been a boatful of\\narmed pirates overlooking an empty sea.\\n\\nThere was a second thought that never came to him. It never\\noccurred to him to be spiritually won over to the enemy. Many\\nmoderns, inured to a weak worship of intellect and force, might\\nhave wavered in their allegiance under this oppression of a great\\npersonality. They might have called Sunday the super-man. If any\\nsuch creature be conceivable, he looked, indeed, somewhat like it,\\nwith his earth-shaking abstraction, as of a stone statue walking.\\nHe might have been called something above man, with his large\\nplans, which were too obvious to be detected, with his large face,\\nwhich was too frank to be understood. But this was a kind of\\nmodern meanness to which Syme could not sink even in his extreme\\nmorbidity. Like any man, he was coward enough to fear great force;\\nbut he was not quite coward enough to admire it.\\n\\nThe men were eating as they talked, and even in this they were\\ntypical. Dr. Bull and the Marquis ate casually and conventionally\\nof the best things on the table--cold pheasant or Strasbourg pie.\\nBut the Secretary was a vegetarian, and he spoke earnestly of the\\nprojected murder over half a raw tomato and three quarters of a\\nglass of tepid water. The old Professor had such slops as suggested\\na sickening second childhood. And even in this President Sunday\\npreserved his curious predominance of mere mass. For he ate like\\ntwenty men; he ate incredibly, with a frightful freshness of\\nappetite, so that it was like watching a sausage factory. Yet\\ncontinually, when he had swallowed a dozen crumpets or drunk a\\nquart of coffee, he would be found with his great head on one side\\nstaring at Syme.\\n\\n\"I have often wondered,\" said the Marquis, taking a great bite out\\nof a slice of bread and jam, \"whether it wouldn\\'t be better for me\\nto do it with a knife. Most of the best things have been brought\\noff with a knife. And it would be a new emotion to get a knife into\\na French President and wriggle it round.\"\\n\\n\"You are wrong,\" said the Secretary, drawing his black brows\\ntogether. \"The knife was merely the expression of the old personal\\nquarrel with a personal tyrant. Dynamite is not only our best tool,\\nbut our best symbol. It is as perfect a symbol of us as is incense\\nof the prayers of the Christians. It expands; it only destroys\\nbecause it broadens; even so, thought only destroys because it\\nbroadens. A man\\'s brain is a bomb,\" he cried out, loosening\\nsuddenly his strange passion and striking his own skull with\\nviolence. \"My brain feels like a bomb, night and day. It must\\nexpand! It must expand! A man\\'s brain must expand, if it breaks up\\nthe universe.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want the universe broken up just yet,\" drawled the\\nMarquis. \"I want to do a lot of beastly things before I die.\\nI thought of one yesterday in bed.\"\\n\\n\"No, if the only end of the thing is nothing,\" said Dr. Bull with\\nhis sphinx-like smile, \"it hardly seems worth doing.\"\\n\\nThe old Professor was staring at the ceiling with dull eyes.\\n\\n\"Every man knows in his heart,\" he said, \"that nothing is worth\\ndoing.\"\\n\\nThere was a singular silence, and then the Secretary said--\\n\\n\"We are wandering, however, from the point. The only question is\\nhow Wednesday is to strike the blow. I take it we should all agree\\nwith the original notion of a bomb. As to the actual arrangements,\\nI should suggest that tomorrow morning he should go first of all\\nto--\"\\n\\nThe speech was broken off short under a vast shadow. President\\nSunday had risen to his feet, seeming to fill the sky above them.\\n\\n\"Before we discuss that,\" he said in a small, quiet voice, \"let us\\ngo into a private room. I have something vent particular to say.\"\\n\\nSyme stood up before any of the others. The instant of choice had\\ncome at last, the pistol was at his head. On the pavement before\\nhe could hear the policeman idly stir and stamp, for the morning,\\nthough bright, was cold.\\n\\nA barrel-organ in the street suddenly sprang with a jerk into a\\njovial tune. Syme stood up taut, as if it had been a bugle before\\nthe battle. He found himself filled with a supernatural courage\\nthat came from nowhere. That jingling music seemed full of the\\nvivacity, the vulgarity, and the irrational valour of the poor, who\\nin all those unclean streets were all clinging to the decencies and\\nthe charities of Christendom. His youthful prank of being a\\npoliceman had faded from his mind; he did not think of himself as\\nthe representative of the corps of gentlemen turned into fancy\\nconstables, or of the old eccentric who lived in the dark room.\\nBut he did feel himself as the ambassador of all these common and\\nkindly people in the street, who every day marched into battle to\\nthe music of the barrel-organ. And this high pride in being human\\nhad lifted him unaccountably to an infinite height above the\\nmonstrous men around him. For an instant, at least, he looked down\\nupon all their sprawling eccentricities from the starry pinnacle\\nof the commonplace. He felt towards them all that unconscious and\\nelementary superiority that a brave man feels over powerful beasts\\nor a wise man over powerful errors. He knew that he had neither the\\nintellectual nor the physical strength of President Sunday; but in\\nthat moment he minded it no more than the fact that he had not the\\nmuscles of a tiger or a horn on his nose like a rhinoceros. All was\\nswallowed up in an ultimate certainty that the President was wrong\\nand that the barrel-organ was right. There clanged in his mind that\\nunanswerable and terrible truism in the song of Roland--\\n\\n\"Pagens ont tort et Chretiens ont droit.\"\\n\\nwhich in the old nasal French has the clang and groan of great\\niron. This liberation of his spirit from the load of his weakness\\nwent with a quite clear decision to embrace death. If the people of\\nthe barrel-organ could keep their old-world obligations, so could\\nhe. This very pride in keeping his word was that he was keeping it\\nto miscreants. It was his last triumph over these lunatics to go\\ndown into their dark room and die for something that they could not\\neven understand. The barrel-organ seemed to give the marching tune\\nwith the energy and the mingled noises of a whole orchestra; and he\\ncould hear deep and rolling, under all the trumpets of the pride of\\nlife, the drums of the pride of death.\\n\\nThe conspirators were already filing through the open window and\\ninto the rooms behind. Syme went last, outwardly calm, but with all\\nhis brain and body throbbing with romantic rhythm. The President\\nled them down an irregular side stair, such as might be used by\\nservants, and into a dim, cold, empty room, with a table and\\nbenches, like an abandoned boardroom. When they were all in, he\\nclosed and locked the door.\\n\\nThe first to speak was Gogol, the irreconcilable, who seemed\\nbursting with inarticulate grievance.\\n\\n\"Zso! Zso!\" he cried, with an obscure excitement, his heavy Polish\\naccent becoming almost impenetrable. \"You zay you nod \\'ide. You zay\\nyou show himselves. It is all nuzzinks. Ven you vant talk\\nimportance you run yourselves in a dark box!\"\\n\\nThe President seemed to take the foreigner\\'s incoherent satire with\\nentire good humour.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t get hold of it yet, Gogol,\" he said in a fatherly way.\\n\"When once they have heard us talking nonsense on that balcony they\\nwill not care where we go afterwards. If we had come here first, we\\nshould have had the whole staff at the keyhole. You don\\'t seem to\\nknow anything about mankind.\"\\n\\n\"I die for zem,\" cried the Pole in thick excitement, \"and I slay\\nzare oppressors. I care not for these games of gonzealment. I would\\nzmite ze tyrant in ze open square.\"\\n\\n\"I see, I see,\" said the President, nodding kindly as he seated\\nhimself at the top of a long table. \"You die for mankind first, and\\nthen you get up and smite their oppressors. So that\\'s all right.\\nAnd now may I ask you to control your beautiful sentiments, and sit\\ndown with the other gentlemen at this table. For the first time\\nthis morning something intelligent is going to be said.\"\\n\\nSyme, with the perturbed promptitude he had shown since the\\noriginal summons, sat down first. Gogol sat down last, grumbling\\nin his brown beard about gombromise. No one except Syme seemed to\\nhave any notion of the blow that was about to fall. As for him,\\nhe had merely the feeling of a man mounting the scaffold with the\\nintention, at any rate, of making a good speech.\\n\\n\"Comrades,\" said the President, suddenly rising, \"we have spun out\\nthis farce long enough. I have called you down here to tell you\\nsomething so simple and shocking that even the waiters upstairs\\n(long inured to our levities) might hear some new seriousness in\\nmy voice. Comrades, we were discussing plans and naming places. I\\npropose, before saying anything else, that those plans and places\\nshould not be voted by this meeting, but should be left wholly in\\nthe control of some one reliable member. I suggest Comrade\\nSaturday, Dr. Bull.\"\\n\\nThey all stared at him; then they all started in their seats, for\\nthe next words, though not loud, had a living and sensational\\nemphasis. Sunday struck the table.\\n\\n\"Not one word more about the plans and places must be said at this\\nmeeting. Not one tiny detail more about what we mean to do must be\\nmentioned in this company.\"\\n\\nSunday had spent his life in astonishing his followers; but it\\nseemed as if he had never really astonished them until now. They\\nall moved feverishly in their seats, except Syme. He sat stiff in\\nhis, with his hand in his pocket, and on the handle of his loaded\\nrevolver. When the attack on him came he would sell his life dear.\\nHe would find out at least if the President was mortal.\\n\\nSunday went on smoothly--\\n\\n\"You will probably understand that there is only one possible\\nmotive for forbidding free speech at this festival of freedom.\\nStrangers overhearing us matters nothing. They assume that we\\nare joking. But what would matter, even unto death, is this,\\nthat there should be one actually among us who is not of us,\\nwho knows our grave purpose, but does not share it, who--\"\\n\\nThe Secretary screamed out suddenly like a woman.\\n\\n\"It can\\'t be!\" he cried, leaping. \"There can\\'t--\"\\n\\nThe President flapped his large flat hand on the table like the\\nfin of some huge fish.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said slowly, \"there is a spy in this room. There is a\\ntraitor at this table. I will waste no more words. His name--\"\\n\\nSyme half rose from his seat, his finger firm on the trigger.\\n\\n\"His name is Gogol,\" said the President. \"He is that hairy humbug\\nover there who pretends to be a Pole.\"\\n\\nGogol sprang to his feet, a pistol in each hand. With the same\\nflash three men sprang at his throat. Even the Professor made\\nan effort to rise. But Syme saw little of the scene, for he was\\nblinded with a beneficent darkness; he had sunk down into his\\nseat shuddering, in a palsy of passionate relief.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nTHE UNACCOUNTABLE CONDUCT OF PROFESSOR DE WORMS\\n\\n\"SIT down!\" said Sunday in a voice that he used once or twice in\\nhis life, a voice that made men drop drawn swords.\\n\\nThe three who had risen fell away from Gogol, and that equivocal\\nperson himself resumed his seat.\\n\\n\"Well, my man,\" said the President briskly, addressing him as one\\naddresses a total stranger, \"will you oblige me by putting your\\nhand in your upper waistcoat pocket and showing me what you have\\nthere?\"\\n\\nThe alleged Pole was a little pale under his tangle of dark hair,\\nbut he put two fingers into the pocket with apparent coolness and\\npulled out a blue strip of card. When Syme saw it lying on the\\ntable, he woke up again to the world outside him. For although\\nthe card lay at the other extreme of the table, and he could read\\nnothing of the inscription on it, it bore a startling resemblance\\nto the blue card in his own pocket, the card which had been given\\nto him when he joined the anti-anarchist constabulary.\\n\\n\"Pathetic Slav,\" said the President, \"tragic child of Poland, are\\nyou prepared in the presence of that card to deny that you are in\\nthis company--shall we say de trop?\"\\n\\n\"Right oh!\" said the late Gogol. It made everyone jump to hear a\\nclear, commercial and somewhat cockney voice coming out of that\\nforest of foreign hair. It was irrational, as if a Chinaman had\\nsuddenly spoken with a Scotch accent.\\n\\n\"I gather that you fully understand your position,\" said Sunday.\\n\\n\"You bet,\" answered the Pole. \"I see it\\'s a fair cop. All I say is,\\nI don\\'t believe any Pole could have imitated my accent like I did\\nhis.\"\\n\\n\"I concede the point,\" said Sunday. \"I believe your own accent to\\nbe inimitable, though I shall practise it in my bath. Do you mind\\nleaving your beard with your card?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit,\" answered Gogol; and with one finger he ripped off the\\nwhole of his shaggy head-covering, emerging with thin red hair and\\na pale, pert face. \"It was hot,\" he added.\\n\\n\"I will do you the justice to say,\" said Sunday, not without a sort\\nof brutal admiration, \"that you seem to have kept pretty cool under\\nit. Now listen to me. I like you. The consequence is that it would\\nannoy me for just about two and a half minutes if I heard that you\\nhad died in torments. Well, if you ever tell the police or any\\nhuman soul about us, I shall have that two and a half minutes of\\ndiscomfort. On your discomfort I will not dwell. Good day. Mind the\\nstep.\"\\n\\nThe red-haired detective who had masqueraded as Gogol rose to his\\nfeet without a word, and walked out of the room with an air of\\nperfect nonchalance. Yet the astonished Syme was able to realise\\nthat this ease was suddenly assumed; for there was a slight stumble\\noutside the door, which showed that the departing detective had not\\nminded the step.\\n\\n\"Time is flying,\" said the President in his gayest manner, after\\nglancing at his watch, which like everything about him seemed\\nbigger than it ought to be. \"I must go off at once; I have to\\ntake the chair at a Humanitarian meeting.\"\\n\\nThe Secretary turned to him with working eyebrows.\\n\\n\"Would it not be better,\" he said a little sharply, \"to discuss\\nfurther the details of our project, now that the spy has left us?\"\\n\\n\"No, I think not,\" said the President with a yawn like an\\nunobtrusive earthquake. \"Leave it as it is. Let Saturday settle\\nit. I must be off. Breakfast here next Sunday.\"\\n\\nBut the late loud scenes had whipped up the almost naked nerves\\nof the Secretary. He was one of those men who are conscientious\\neven in crime.\\n\\n\"I must protest, President, that the thing is irregular,\" he said.\\n\"It is a fundamental rule of our society that all plans shall be\\ndebated in full council. Of course, I fully appreciate your\\nforethought when in the actual presence of a traitor--\"\\n\\n\"Secretary,\" said the President seriously, \"if you\\'d take your head\\nhome and boil it for a turnip it might be useful. I can\\'t say. But\\nit might.\\n\\nThe Secretary reared back in a kind of equine anger.\\n\\n\"I really fail to understand--\" he began in high offense.\\n\\n\"That\\'s it, that\\'s it,\" said the President, nodding a great many\\ntimes. \"That\\'s where you fail right enough. You fail to understand.\\nWhy, you dancing donkey,\" he roared, rising, \"you didn\\'t want to be\\noverheard by a spy, didn\\'t you? How do you know you aren\\'t\\noverheard now?\"\\n\\nAnd with these words he shouldered his way out of the room, shaking\\nwith incomprehensible scorn.\\n\\nFour of the men left behind gaped after him without any apparent\\nglimmering of his meaning. Syme alone had even a glimmering, and\\nsuch as it was it froze him to the bone. If the last words of the\\nPresident meant anything, they meant that he had not after all\\npassed unsuspected. They meant that while Sunday could not denounce\\nhim like Gogol, he still could not trust him like the others.\\n\\nThe other four got to their feet grumbling more or less, and betook\\nthemselves elsewhere to find lunch, for it was already well past\\nmidday. The Professor went last, very slowly and painfully. Syme\\nsat long after the rest had gone, revolving his strange position.\\nHe had escaped a thunderbolt, but he was still under a cloud. At\\nlast he rose and made his way out of the hotel into Leicester\\nSquare. The bright, cold day had grown increasingly colder, and\\nwhen he came out into the street he was surprised by a few flakes\\nof snow. While he still carried the sword-stick and the rest of\\nGregory\\'s portable luggage, he had thrown the cloak down and left\\nit somewhere, perhaps on the steam-tug, perhaps on the balcony.\\nHoping, therefore, that the snow-shower might be slight, he stepped\\nback out of the street for a moment and stood up under the doorway\\nof a small and greasy hair-dresser\\'s shop, the front window of\\nwhich was empty, except for a sickly wax lady in evening dress.\\n\\nSnow, however, began to thicken and fall fast; and Syme, having\\nfound one glance at the wax lady quite sufficient to depress his\\nspirits, stared out instead into the white and empty street. He was\\nconsiderably astonished to see, standing quite still outside the\\nshop and staring into the window, a man. His top hat was loaded\\nwith snow like the hat of Father Christmas, the white drift was\\nrising round his boots and ankles; but it seemed as if nothing\\ncould tear him away from the contemplation of the colourless wax\\ndoll in dirty evening dress. That any human being should stand in\\nsuch weather looking into such a shop was a matter of sufficient\\nwonder to Syme; but his idle wonder turned suddenly into a personal\\nshock; for he realised that the man standing there was the\\nparalytic old Professor de Worms. It scarcely seemed the place for\\na person of his years and infirmities.\\n\\nSyme was ready to believe anything about the perversions of this\\ndehumanized brotherhood; but even he could not believe that the\\nProfessor had fallen in love with that particular wax lady. He\\ncould only suppose that the man\\'s malady (whatever it was) involved\\nsome momentary fits of rigidity or trance. He was not inclined,\\nhowever, to feel in this case any very compassionate concern. On\\nthe contrary, he rather congratulated himself that the Professor\\'s\\nstroke and his elaborate and limping walk would make it easy to\\nescape from him and leave him miles behind. For Syme thirsted first\\nand last to get clear of the whole poisonous atmosphere, if only\\nfor an hour. Then he could collect his thoughts, formulate his\\npolicy, and decide finally whether he should or should not keep\\nfaith with Gregory.\\n\\nHe strolled away through the dancing snow, turned up two or three\\nstreets, down through two or three others, and entered a small Soho\\nrestaurant for lunch. He partook reflectively of four small and\\nquaint courses, drank half a bottle of red wine, and ended up over\\nblack coffee and a black cigar, still thinking. He had taken his\\nseat in the upper room of the restaurant, which was full of the\\nchink of knives and the chatter of foreigners. He remembered that\\nin old days he had imagined that all these harmless and kindly\\naliens were anarchists. He shuddered, remembering the real thing.\\nBut even the shudder had the delightful shame of escape. The wine,\\nthe common food, the familiar place, the faces of natural and\\ntalkative men, made him almost feel as if the Council of the Seven\\nDays had been a bad dream; and although he knew it was nevertheless\\nan objective reality, it was at least a distant one. Tall houses\\nand populous streets lay between him and his last sight of the\\nshameful seven; he was free in free London, and drinking wine among\\nthe free. With a somewhat easier action, he took his hat and stick\\nand strolled down the stair into the shop below.\\n\\nWhen he entered that lower room he stood stricken and rooted to the\\nspot. At a small table, close up to the blank window and the white\\nstreet of snow, sat the old anarchist Professor over a glass of\\nmilk, with his lifted livid face and pendent eyelids. For an\\ninstant Syme stood as rigid as the stick he leant upon. Then with a\\ngesture as of blind hurry, he brushed past the Professor, dashing\\nopen the door and slamming it behind him, and stood outside in the\\nsnow.\\n\\n\"Can that old corpse be following me?\" he asked himself, biting his\\nyellow moustache. \"I stopped too long up in that room, so that even\\nsuch leaden feet could catch me up. One comfort is, with a little\\nbrisk walking I can put a man like that as far away as Timbuctoo.\\nOr am I too fanciful? Was he really following me? Surely Sunday\\nwould not be such a fool as to send a lame man? \"\\n\\nHe set off at a smart pace, twisting and whirling his stick, in\\nthe direction of Covent Garden. As he crossed the great market the\\nsnow increased, growing blinding and bewildering as the afternoon\\nbegan to darken. The snow-flakes tormented him like a swarm of\\nsilver bees. Getting into his eyes and beard, they added their\\nunremitting futility to his already irritated nerves; and by the\\ntime that he had come at a swinging pace to the beginning of Fleet\\nStreet, he lost patience, and finding a Sunday teashop, turned\\ninto it to take shelter. He ordered another cup of black coffee\\nas an excuse. Scarcely had he done so, when Professor de Worms\\nhobbled heavily into the shop, sat down with difficulty and\\nordered a glass of milk.\\n\\nSyme\\'s walking-stick had fallen from his hand with a great clang,\\nwhich confessed the concealed steel. But the Professor did not look\\nround. Syme, who was commonly a cool character, was literally\\ngaping as a rustic gapes at a conjuring trick. He had seen no cab\\nfollowing; he had heard no wheels outside the shop; to all mortal\\nappearances the man had come on foot. But the old man could only\\nwalk like a snail, and Syme had walked like the wind. He started up\\nand snatched his stick, half crazy with the contradiction in mere\\narithmetic, and swung out of the swinging doors, leaving his coffee\\nuntasted. An omnibus going to the Bank went rattling by with an\\nunusual rapidity. He had a violent run of a hundred yards to reach\\nit; but he managed to spring, swaying upon the splash-board and,\\npausing for an instant to pant, he climbed on to the top. When he\\nhad been seated for about half a minute, he heard behind him a sort\\nof heavy and asthmatic breathing.\\n\\nTurning sharply, he saw rising gradually higher and higher up\\nthe omnibus steps a top hat soiled and dripping with snow, and\\nunder the shadow of its brim the short-sighted face and shaky\\nshoulders of Professor de Worms. He let himself into a seat with\\ncharacteristic care, and wrapped himself up to the chin in the\\nmackintosh rug.\\n\\nEvery movement of the old man\\'s tottering figure and vague hands,\\nevery uncertain gesture and panic-stricken pause, seemed to put\\nit beyond question that he was helpless, that he was in the last\\nimbecility of the body. He moved by inches, he let himself down\\nwith little gasps of caution. And yet, unless the philosophical\\nentities called time and space have no vestige even of a practical\\nexistence, it appeared quite unquestionable that he had run after\\nthe omnibus.\\n\\nSyme sprang erect upon the rocking car, and after staring wildly\\nat the wintry sky, that grew gloomier every moment, he ran down\\nthe steps. He had repressed an elemental impulse to leap over the\\nside.\\n\\nToo bewildered to look back or to reason, he rushed into one of\\nthe little courts at the side of Fleet Street as a rabbit rushes\\ninto a hole. He had a vague idea, if this incomprehensible old\\nJack-in-the-box was really pursuing him, that in that labyrinth of\\nlittle streets he could soon throw him off the scent. He dived in\\nand out of those crooked lanes, which were more like cracks than\\nthoroughfares; and by the time that he had completed about twenty\\nalternate angles and described an unthinkable polygon, he paused\\nto listen for any sound of pursuit. There was none; there could\\nnot in any case have been much, for the little streets were thick\\nwith the soundless snow. Somewhere behind Red Lion Court, however,\\nhe noticed a place where some energetic citizen had cleared away\\nthe snow for a space of about twenty yards, leaving the wet,\\nglistening cobble-stones. He thought little of this as he passed\\nit, only plunging into yet another arm of the maze. But when a few\\nhundred yards farther on he stood still again to listen, his heart\\nstood still also, for he heard from that space of rugged stones\\nthe clinking crutch and labouring feet of the infernal cripple.\\n\\nThe sky above was loaded with the clouds of snow, leaving London\\nin a darkness and oppression premature for that hour of the\\nevening. On each side of Syme the walls of the alley were blind\\nand featureless; there was no little window or any kind of eve. He\\nfelt a new impulse to break out of this hive of houses, and to get\\nonce more into the open and lamp-lit street. Yet he rambled and\\ndodged for a long time before he struck the main thoroughfare.\\nWhen he did so, he struck it much farther up than he had fancied.\\nHe came out into what seemed the vast and void of Ludgate Circus,\\nand saw St. Paul\\'s Cathedral sitting in the sky.\\n\\nAt first he was startled to find these great roads so empty, as if\\na pestilence had swept through the city. Then he told himself that\\nsome degree of emptiness was natural; first because the snow-storm\\nwas even dangerously deep, and secondly because it was Sunday. And\\nat the very word Sunday he bit his lip; the word was henceforth for\\nhire like some indecent pun. Under the white fog of snow high up in\\nthe heaven the whole atmosphere of the city was turned to a very\\nqueer kind of green twilight, as of men under the sea. The sealed\\nand sullen sunset behind the dark dome of St. Paul\\'s had in it\\nsmoky and sinister colours--colours of sickly green, dead red or\\ndecaying bronze, that were just bright enough to emphasise the\\nsolid whiteness of the snow. But right up against these dreary\\ncolours rose the black bulk of the cathedral; and upon the top of\\nthe cathedral was a random splash and great stain of snow, still\\nclinging as to an Alpine peak. It had fallen accidentally, but just\\nso fallen as to half drape the dome from its very topmost point,\\nand to pick out in perfect silver the great orb and the cross. When\\nSyme saw it he suddenly straightened himself, and made with his\\nsword-stick an involuntary salute.\\n\\nHe knew that that evil figure, his shadow, was creeping quickly or\\nslowly behind him, and he did not care.\\n\\nIt seemed a symbol of human faith and valour that while the skies\\nwere darkening that high place of the earth was bright. The\\ndevils might have captured heaven, but they had not yet captured\\nthe cross. He had a new impulse to tear out the secret of this\\ndancing, jumping and pursuing paralytic; and at the entrance of\\nthe court as it opened upon the Circus he turned, stick in hand,\\nto face his pursuer.\\n\\nProfessor de Worms came slowly round the corner of the irregular\\nalley behind him, his unnatural form outlined against a lonely\\ngas-lamp, irresistibly recalling that very imaginative figure in\\nthe nursery rhymes, \"the crooked man who went a crooked mile.\" He\\nreally looked as if he had been twisted out of shape by the\\ntortuous streets he had been threading. He came nearer and nearer,\\nthe lamplight shining on his lifted spectacles, his lifted,\\npatient face. Syme waited for him as St. George waited for the\\ndragon, as a man waits for a final explanation or for death. And\\nthe old Professor came right up to him and passed him like a total\\nstranger, without even a blink of his mournful eyelids.\\n\\nThere was something in this silent and unexpected innocence that\\nleft Syme in a final fury. The man\\'s colourless face and manner\\nseemed to assert that the whole following had been an accident.\\nSyme was galvanised with an energy that was something between\\nbitterness and a burst of boyish derision. He made a wild gesture\\nas if to knock the old man\\'s hat off, called out something like\\n\"Catch me if you can,\" and went racing away across the white, open\\nCircus. Concealment was impossible now; and looking back over his\\nshoulder, he could see the black figure of the old gentleman coming\\nafter him with long, swinging strides like a man winning a mile\\nrace. But the head upon that bounding body was still pale, grave\\nand professional, like the head of a lecturer upon the body of a\\nharlequin.\\n\\nThis outrageous chase sped across Ludgate Circus, up Ludgate Hill,\\nround St. Paul\\'s Cathedral, along Cheapside, Syme remembering all\\nthe nightmares he had ever known. Then Syme broke away towards the\\nriver, and ended almost down by the docks. He saw the yellow panes\\nof a low, lighted public-house, flung himself into it and ordered\\nbeer. It was a foul tavern, sprinkled with foreign sailors, a\\nplace where opium might be smoked or knives drawn.\\n\\nA moment later Professor de Worms entered the place, sat down\\ncarefully, and asked for a glass of milk.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nTHE PROFESSOR EXPLAINS\\n\\nWHEN Gabriel Syme found himself finally established in a chair,\\nand opposite to him, fixed and final also, the lifted eyebrows and\\nleaden eyelids of the Professor, his fears fully returned. This\\nincomprehensible man from the fierce council, after all, had\\ncertainly pursued him. If the man had one character as a paralytic\\nand another character as a pursuer, the antithesis might make him\\nmore interesting, but scarcely more soothing. It would be a very\\nsmall comfort that he could not find the Professor out, if by some\\nserious accident the Professor should find him out. He emptied a\\nwhole pewter pot of ale before the professor had touched his milk.\\n\\nOne possibility, however, kept him hopeful and yet helpless. It was\\njust possible that this escapade signified something other than\\neven a slight suspicion of him. Perhaps it was some regular form or\\nsign. Perhaps the foolish scamper was some sort of friendly signal\\nthat he ought to have understood. Perhaps it was a ritual. Perhaps\\nthe new Thursday was always chased along Cheapside, as the new Lord\\nMayor is always escorted along it. He was just selecting a\\ntentative inquiry, when the old Professor opposite suddenly and\\nsimply cut him short. Before Syme could ask the first diplomatic\\nquestion, the old anarchist had asked suddenly, without any sort of\\npreparation--\\n\\n\"Are you a policeman?\"\\n\\nWhatever else Syme had expected, he had never expected anything so\\nbrutal and actual as this. Even his great presence of mind could\\nonly manage a reply with an air of rather blundering jocularity.\\n\\n\"A policeman?\" he said, laughing vaguely. \"Whatever made you think\\nof a policeman in connection with me?\"\\n\\n\"The process was simple enough,\" answered the Professor patiently.\\n\"I thought you looked like a policeman. I think so now.\"\\n\\n\"Did I take a policeman\\'s hat by mistake out of the restaurant?\"\\nasked Syme, smiling wildly. \"Have I by any chance got a number\\nstuck on to me somewhere? Have my boots got that watchful look?\\nWhy must I be a policeman? Do, do let me be a postman.\"\\n\\nThe old Professor shook his head with a gravity that gave no hope,\\nbut Syme ran on with a feverish irony.\\n\\n\"But perhaps I misunderstood the delicacies of your German\\nphilosophy. Perhaps policeman is a relative term. In an\\nevolutionary sense, sir, the ape fades so gradually into the\\npoliceman, that I myself can never detect the shade. The monkey is\\nonly the policeman that may be. Perhaps a maiden lady on Clapham\\nCommon is only the policeman that might have been. I don\\'t mind\\nbeing the policeman that might have been. I don\\'t mind being\\nanything in German thought.\"\\n\\n\"Are you in the police service?\" said the old man, ignoring all\\nSyme\\'s improvised and desperate raillery. \"Are you a detective?\"\\n\\nSyme\\'s heart turned to stone, but his face never changed.\\n\\n\"Your suggestion is ridiculous,\" he began. \"Why on earth--\"\\n\\nThe old man struck his palsied hand passionately on the rickety\\ntable, nearly breaking it.\\n\\n\"Did you hear me ask a plain question, you pattering spy?\" he\\nshrieked in a high, crazy voice. \"Are you, or are you not, a\\npolice detective?\"\\n\\n\"No!\" answered Syme, like a man standing on the hangman\\'s drop.\\n\\n\"You swear it,\" said the old man, leaning across to him, his dead\\nface becoming as it were loathsomely alive. \"You swear it! You\\nswear it! If you swear falsely, will you be damned? Will you be\\nsure that the devil dances at your funeral? Will you see that the\\nnightmare sits on your grave? Will there really be no mistake? You\\nare an anarchist, you are a dynamiter! Above all, you are not in\\nany sense a detective? You are not in the British police?\"\\n\\nHe leant his angular elbow far across the table, and put up his\\nlarge loose hand like a flap to his ear.\\n\\n\"I am not in the British police,\" said Syme with insane calm.\\n\\nProfessor de Worms fell back in his chair with a curious air of\\nkindly collapse.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a pity,\" he said, \"because I am.\"\\n\\nSyme sprang up straight, sending back the bench behind him with a\\ncrash.\\n\\n\"Because you are what?\" he said thickly. \"You are what?\"\\n\\n\"I am a policeman,\" said the Professor with his first broad smile.\\nand beaming through his spectacles. \"But as you think policeman\\nonly a relative term, of course I have nothing to do with you. I\\nam in the British police force; but as you tell me you are not in\\nthe British police force, I can only say that I met you in a\\ndynamiters\\' club. I suppose I ought to arrest you.\" And with these\\nwords he laid on the table before Syme an exact facsimile of the\\nblue card which Syme had in his own waistcoat pocket, the symbol\\nof his power from the police.\\n\\nSyme had for a flash the sensation that the cosmos had turned\\nexactly upside down, that all trees were growing downwards and\\nthat all stars were under his feet. Then came slowly the opposite\\nconviction. For the last twenty-four hours the cosmos had really\\nbeen upside down, but now the capsized universe had come right side\\nup again. This devil from whom he had been fleeing all day was only\\nan elder brother of his own house, who on the other side of the\\ntable lay back and laughed at him. He did not for the moment ask\\nany questions of detail; he only knew the happy and silly fact that\\nthis shadow, which had pursued him with an intolerable oppression\\nof peril, was only the shadow of a friend trying to catch him up.\\nHe knew simultaneously that he was a fool and a free man. For with\\nany recovery from morbidity there must go a certain healthy\\nhumiliation. There comes a certain point in such conditions when\\nonly three things are possible: first a perpetuation of Satanic\\npride, secondly tears, and third laughter. Syme\\'s egotism held hard\\nto the first course for a few seconds, and then suddenly adopted\\nthe third. Taking his own blue police ticket from his own waist\\ncoat pocket, he tossed it on to the table; then he flung his head\\nback until his spike of yellow beard almost pointed at the ceiling,\\nand shouted with a barbaric laughter.\\n\\nEven in that close den, perpetually filled with the din of knives,\\nplates, cans, clamorous voices, sudden struggles and stampedes,\\nthere was something Homeric in Syme\\'s mirth which made many\\nhalf-drunken men look round.\\n\\n\"What yer laughing at, guv\\'nor?\" asked one wondering labourer from\\nthe docks.\\n\\n\"At myself,\" answered Syme, and went off again into the agony of\\nhis ecstatic reaction.\\n\\n\"Pull yourself together,\" said the Professor, \"or you\\'ll get\\nhysterical. Have some more beer. I\\'ll join you.\"\\n\\n\"You haven\\'t drunk your milk,\" said Syme.\\n\\n\"My milk!\" said the other, in tones of withering and unfathomable\\ncontempt, \"my milk! Do you think I\\'d look at the beastly stuff when\\nI\\'m out of sight of the bloody anarchists? We\\'re all Christians in\\nthis room, though perhaps,\" he added, glancing around at the\\nreeling crowd, \"not strict ones. Finish my milk? Great blazes! yes,\\nI\\'ll finish it right enough!\" and he knocked the tumbler off the\\ntable, making a crash of glass and a splash of silver fluid.\\n\\nSyme was staring at him with a happy curiosity.\\n\\n\"I understand now,\" he cried; \"of course, you\\'re not an old man at\\nall.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t take my face off here,\" replied Professor de Worms. \"It\\'s\\nrather an elaborate make-up. As to whether I\\'m an old man, that\\'s\\nnot for me to say. I was thirty-eight last birthday.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but I mean,\" said Syme impatiently, \"there\\'s nothing the\\nmatter with you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered the other dispassionately. \"I am subject to colds.\"\\n\\nSyme\\'s laughter at all this had about it a wild weakness of relief.\\nHe laughed at the idea of the paralytic Professor being really a\\nyoung actor dressed up as if for the foot-lights. But he felt that\\nhe would have laughed as loudly if a pepperpot had fallen over.\\n\\nThe false Professor drank and wiped his false beard.\\n\\n\"Did you know,\" he asked, \"that that man Gogol was one of us?\"\\n\\n\"I? No, I didn\\'t know it,\" answered Syme in some surprise. \"But\\ndidn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"I knew no more than the dead,\" replied the man who called himself\\nde Worms. \"I thought the President was talking about me, and I\\nrattled in my boots.\"\\n\\n\"And I thought he was talking about me,\" said Syme, with his rather\\nreckless laughter. \"I had my hand on my revolver all the time.\"\\n\\n\"So had I,\" said the Professor grimly; \"so had Gogol evidently.\"\\n\\nSyme struck the table with an exclamation.\\n\\n\"Why, there were three of us there!\" he cried. \"Three out of seven\\nis a fighting number. If we had only known that we were three!\"\\n\\nThe face of Professor de Worms darkened, and he did not look up.\\n\\n\"We were three,\" he said. \"If we had been three hundred we could\\nstill have done nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Not if we were three hundred against four?\" asked Syme, jeering\\nrather boisterously.\\n\\n\"No,\" said the Professor with sobriety, \"not if we were three\\nhundred against Sunday.\"\\n\\nAnd the mere name struck Syme cold and serious; his laughter had\\ndied in his heart before it could die on his lips. The face of\\nthe unforgettable President sprang into his mind as startling as\\na coloured photograph, and he remarked this difference between\\nSunday and all his satellites, that their faces, however fierce\\nor sinister, became gradually blurred by memory like other human\\nfaces, whereas Sunday\\'s seemed almost to grow more actual during\\nabsence, as if a man\\'s painted portrait should slowly come alive.\\n\\nThey were both silent for a measure of moments, and then Syme\\'s\\nspeech came with a rush, like the sudden foaming of champagne.\\n\\n\"Professor,\" he cried, \"it is intolerable. Are you afraid of this\\nman?\"\\n\\nThe Professor lifted his heavy lids, and gazed at Syme with large,\\nwide-open, blue eyes of an almost ethereal honesty.\\n\\n\"Yes, I am,\" he said mildly. \"So are you.\"\\n\\nSyme was dumb for an instant. Then he rose to his feet erect, like\\nan insulted man, and thrust the chair away from him.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said in a voice indescribable, \"you are right. I am\\nafraid of him. Therefore I swear by God that I will seek out this\\nman whom I fear until I find him, and strike him on the mouth. If\\nheaven were his throne and the earth his footstool, I swear that\\nI would pull him down.\"\\n\\n\"How?\" asked the staring Professor. \"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Because I am afraid of him,\" said Syme; \"and no man should leave\\nin the universe anything of which he is afraid.\"\\n\\nDe Worms blinked at him with a sort of blind wonder. He made an\\neffort to speak, but Syme went on in a low voice, but with an\\nundercurrent of inhuman exaltation--\\n\\n\"Who would condescend to strike down the mere things that he does\\nnot fear? Who would debase himself to be merely brave, like any\\ncommon prizefighter? Who would stoop to be fearless--like a tree?\\nFight the thing that you fear. You remember the old tale of the\\nEnglish clergyman who gave the last rites to the brigand of Sicily,\\nand how on his death-bed the great robber said, \\'I can give you no\\nmoney, but I can give you advice for a lifetime: your thumb on the\\nblade, and strike upwards.\\' So I say to you, strike upwards, if you\\nstrike at the stars.\"\\n\\nThe other looked at the ceiling, one of the tricks of his pose.\\n\\n\"Sunday is a fixed star,\" he said.\\n\\n\"You shall see him a falling star,\" said Syme, and put on his hat.\\n\\nThe decision of his gesture drew the Professor vaguely to his feet.\\n\\n\"Have you any idea,\" he asked, with a sort of benevolent\\nbewilderment, \"exactly where you are going?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied Syme shortly, \"I am going to prevent this bomb being\\nthrown in Paris.\"\\n\\n\"Have you any conception how?\" inquired the other.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Syme with equal decision.\\n\\n\"You remember, of course,\" resumed the soi-disant de Worms, pulling\\nhis beard and looking out of the window, \"that when we broke up\\nrather hurriedly the whole arrangements for the atrocity were left\\nin the private hands of the Marquis and Dr. Bull. The Marquis is by\\nthis time probably crossing the Channel. But where he will go and\\nwhat he will do it is doubtful whether even the President knows;\\ncertainly we don\\'t know. The only man who does know is Dr. Bull.\\n\\n\"Confound it!\" cried Syme. \"And we don\\'t know where he is.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the other in his curious, absent-minded way, \"I know\\nwhere he is myself.\"\\n\\n\"Will you tell me?\" asked Syme with eager eyes.\\n\\n\"I will take you there,\" said the Professor, and took down his own\\nhat from a peg.\\n\\nSyme stood looking at him with a sort of rigid excitement.\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked sharply. \"Will you join me? Will you\\ntake the risk?\"\\n\\n\"Young man,\" said the Professor pleasantly, \"I am amused to observe\\nthat you think I am a coward. As to that I will say only one word,\\nand that shall be entirely in the manner of your own philosophical\\nrhetoric. You think that it is possible to pull down the President.\\nI know that it is impossible, and I am going to try it,\" and\\nopening the tavern door, which let in a blast of bitter air, they\\nwent out together into the dark streets by the docks.\\n\\nMost of the snow was melted or trampled to mud, but here and there\\na clot of it still showed grey rather than white in the gloom. The\\nsmall streets were sloppy and full of pools, which reflected the\\nflaming lamps irregularly, and by accident, like fragments of some\\nother and fallen world. Syme felt almost dazed as he stepped\\nthrough this growing confusion of lights and shadows; but his\\ncompanion walked on with a certain briskness, towards where, at\\nthe end of the street, an inch or two of the lamplit river looked\\nlike a bar of flame.\\n\\n\"Where are you going?\" Syme inquired.\\n\\n\"Just now,\" answered the Professor, \"I am going just round the\\ncorner to see whether Dr. Bull has gone to bed. He is hygienic,\\nand retires early.\"\\n\\n\"Dr. Bull!\" exclaimed Syme. \"Does he live round the corner?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" answered his friend. \"As a matter of fact he lives some way\\noff, on the other side of the river, but we can tell from here\\nwhether he has gone to bed.\"\\n\\nTurning the corner as he spoke, and facing the dim river, flecked\\nwith flame, he pointed with his stick to the other bank. On the\\nSurrey side at this point there ran out into the Thames, seeming\\nalmost to overhang it, a bulk and cluster of those tall tenements,\\ndotted with lighted windows, and rising like factory chimneys to\\nan almost insane height. Their special poise and position made one\\nblock of buildings especially look like a Tower of Babel with a\\nhundred eyes. Syme had never seen any of the sky-scraping buildings\\nin America, so he could only think of the buildings in a dream.\\n\\nEven as he stared, the highest light in this innumerably lighted\\nturret abruptly went out, as if this black Argus had winked at him\\nwith one of his innumerable eyes.\\n\\nProfessor de Worms swung round on his heel, and struck his stick\\nagainst his boot.\\n\\n\"We are too late,\" he said, \"the hygienic Doctor has gone to bed.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Syme. \"Does he live over there, then?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said de Worms, \"behind that particular window which you\\ncan\\'t see. Come along and get some dinner. We must call on him\\ntomorrow morning.\"\\n\\nWithout further parley, he led the way through several by-ways\\nuntil they came out into the flare and clamour of the East India\\nDock Road. The Professor, who seemed to know his way about the\\nneighbourhood, proceeded to a place where the line of lighted\\nshops fell back into a sort of abrupt twilight and quiet, in which\\nan old white inn, all out of repair, stood back some twenty feet\\nfrom the road.\\n\\n\"You can find good English inns left by accident everywhere, like\\nfossils,\" explained the Professor. \"I once found a decent place in\\nthe West End.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose,\" said Syme, smiling, \"that this is the corresponding\\ndecent place in the East End?\"\\n\\n\"It is,\" said the Professor reverently, and went in.\\n\\nIn that place they dined and slept, both very thoroughly. The\\nbeans and bacon, which these unaccountable people cooked well,\\nthe astonishing emergence of Burgundy from their cellars, crowned\\nSyme\\'s sense of a new comradeship and comfort. Through all this\\nordeal his root horror had been isolation, and there are no words\\nto express the abyss between isolation and having one ally. It may\\nbe conceded to the mathematicians that four is twice two. But two\\nis not twice one; two is two thousand times one. That is why, in\\nspite of a hundred disadvantages, the world will always return to\\nmonogamy.\\n\\nSyme was able to pour out for the first time the whole of his\\noutrageous tale, from the time when Gregory had taken him to\\nthe little tavern by the river. He did it idly and amply, in a\\nluxuriant monologue, as a man speaks with very old friends. On\\nhis side, also, the man who had impersonated Professor de Worms\\nwas not less communicative. His own story was almost as silly as\\nSyme\\'s.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a good get-up of yours,\" said Syme, draining a glass of\\nMacon; \"a lot better than old Gogol\\'s. Even at the start I thought\\nhe was a bit too hairy.\"\\n\\n\"A difference of artistic theory,\" replied the Professor pensively.\\n\"Gogol was an idealist. He made up as the abstract or platonic\\nideal of an anarchist. But I am a realist. I am a portrait painter.\\nBut, indeed, to say that I am a portrait painter is an inadequate\\nexpression. I am a portrait.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand you,\" said Syme.\\n\\n\"I am a portrait,\" repeated the Professor. \"I am a portrait of the\\ncelebrated Professor de Worms, who is, I believe, in Naples.\"\\n\\n\"You mean you are made up like him,\" said Syme. \"But doesn\\'t he\\nknow that you are taking his nose in vain?\"\\n\\n\"He knows it right enough,\" replied his friend cheerfully.\\n\\n\"Then why doesn\\'t he denounce you?\"\\n\\n\"I have denounced him,\" answered the Professor.\\n\\n\"Do explain yourself,\" said Syme.\\n\\n\"With pleasure, if you don\\'t mind hearing my story,\" replied the\\neminent foreign philosopher. \"I am by profession an actor, and my\\nname is Wilks. When I was on the stage I mixed with all sorts of\\nBohemian and blackguard company. Sometimes I touched the edge of\\nthe turf, sometimes the riff-raff of the arts, and occasionally the\\npolitical refugee. In some den of exiled dreamers I was introduced\\nto the great German Nihilist philosopher, Professor de Worms. I did\\nnot gather much about him beyond his appearance, which was very\\ndisgusting, and which I studied carefully. I understood that he had\\nproved that the destructive principle in the universe was God;\\nhence he insisted on the need for a furious and incessant energy,\\nrending all things in pieces. Energy, he said, was the All. He was\\nlame, shortsighted, and partially paralytic. When I met him I was\\nin a frivolous mood, and I disliked him so much that I resolved to\\nimitate him. If I had been a draughtsman I would have drawn a\\ncaricature. I was only an actor, I could only act a caricature. I\\nmade myself up into what was meant for a wild exaggeration of the\\nold Professor\\'s dirty old self. When I went into the room full of\\nhis supporters I expected to be received with a roar of laughter,\\nor (if they were too far gone) with a roar of indignation at the\\ninsult. I cannot describe the surprise I felt when my entrance was\\nreceived with a respectful silence, followed (when I had first\\nopened my lips) with a murmur of admiration. The curse of the\\nperfect artist had fallen upon me. I had been too subtle, I had\\nbeen too true. They thought I really was the great Nihilist\\nProfessor. I was a healthy-minded young man at the time, and I\\nconfess that it was a blow. Before I could fully recover, however,\\ntwo or three of these admirers ran up to me radiating indignation,\\nand told me that a public insult had been put upon me in the next\\nroom. I inquired its nature. It seemed that an impertinent fellow\\nhad dressed himself up as a preposterous parody of myself. I had\\ndrunk more champagne than was good for me, and in a flash of folly\\nI decided to see the situation through. Consequently it was to meet\\nthe glare of the company and my own lifted eyebrows and freezing\\neyes that the real Professor came into the room.\\n\\n\"I need hardly say there was a collision. The pessimists all round\\nme looked anxiously from one Professor to the other Professor to\\nsee which was really the more feeble. But I won. An old man in poor\\nhealth, like my rival, could not be expected to be so impressively\\nfeeble as a young actor in the prime of life. You see, he really\\nhad paralysis, and working within this definite limitation, he\\ncouldn\\'t be so jolly paralytic as I was. Then he tried to blast my\\nclaims intellectually. I countered that by a very simple dodge.\\nWhenever he said something that nobody but he could understand, I\\nreplied with something which I could not even understand myself.\\n\\'I don\\'t fancy,\\' he said, \\'that you could have worked out the\\nprinciple that evolution is only negation, since there inheres in\\nit the introduction of lacuna, which are an essential of\\ndifferentiation.\\' I replied quite scornfully, \\'You read all that up\\nin Pinckwerts; the notion that involution functioned eugenically\\nwas exposed long ago by Glumpe.\\' It is unnecessary for me to say\\nthat there never were such people as Pinckwerts and Glumpe. But the\\npeople all round (rather to my surprise) seemed to remember them\\nquite well, and the Professor, finding that the learned and\\nmysterious method left him rather at the mercy of an enemy slightly\\ndeficient in scruples, fell back upon a more popular form of wit.\\n\\'I see,\\' he sneered, \\'you prevail like the false pig in Aesop.\\'\\n\\'And you fail,\\' I answered, smiling, \\'like the hedgehog in\\nMontaigne.\\' Need I say that there is no hedgehog in Montaigne?\\n\\'Your claptrap comes off,\\' he said; \\'so would your beard.\\' I had no\\nintelligent answer to this, which was quite true and rather witty.\\nBut I laughed heartily, answered, \\'Like the Pantheist\\'s boots,\\' at\\nrandom, and turned on my heel with all the honours of victory. The\\nreal Professor was thrown out, but not with violence, though one\\nman tried very patiently to pull off his nose. He is now, I\\nbelieve, received everywhere in Europe as a delightful impostor.\\nHis apparent earnestness and anger, you see, make him all the more\\nentertaining.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Syme, \"I can understand your putting on his dirty old\\nbeard for a night\\'s practical joke, but I don\\'t understand your\\nnever taking it off again.\"\\n\\n\"That is the rest of the story,\" said the impersonator. \"When I\\nmyself left the company, followed by reverent applause, I went\\nlimping down the dark street, hoping that I should soon be far\\nenough away to be able to walk like a human being. To my\\nastonishment, as I was turning the corner, I felt a touch on the\\nshoulder, and turning, found myself under the shadow of an enormous\\npoliceman. He told me I was wanted. I struck a sort of paralytic\\nattitude, and cried in a high German accent, \\'Yes, I am wanted--by\\nthe oppressed of the world. You are arresting me on the charge of\\nbeing the great anarchist, Professor de Worms.\\' The policeman\\nimpassively consulted a paper in his hand, \\'No, sir,\\' he said\\ncivilly, \\'at least, not exactly, sir. I am arresting you on the\\ncharge of not being the celebrated anarchist, Professor de Worms.\\'\\nThis charge, if it was criminal at all, was certainly the lighter\\nof the two, and I went along with the man, doubtful, but not\\ngreatly dismayed. I was shown into a number of rooms, and\\neventually into the presence of a police officer, who explained\\nthat a serious campaign had been opened against the centres of\\nanarchy, and that this, my successful masquerade, might be of\\nconsiderable value to the public safety. He offered me a good\\nsalary and this little blue card. Though our conversation was\\nshort, he struck me as a man of very massive common sense and\\nhumour; but I cannot tell you much about him personally, because--\"\\n\\nSyme laid down his knife and fork.\\n\\n\"I know,\" he said, \"because you talked to him in a dark room.\"\\n\\nProfessor de Worms nodded and drained his glass.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nTHE MAN IN SPECTACLES\\n\\n\"BURGUNDY is a jolly thing,\" said the Professor sadly, as he set\\nhis glass down.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t look as if it were,\" said Syme; \"you drink it as if it\\nwere medicine.\"\\n\\n\"You must excuse my manner,\" said the Professor dismally, \"my\\nposition is rather a curious one. Inside I am really bursting with\\nboyish merriment; but I acted the paralytic Professor so well, that\\nnow I can\\'t leave off. So that when I am among friends, and have no\\nneed at all to disguise myself, I still can\\'t help speaking slow\\nand wrinkling my forehead--just as if it were my forehead. I can be\\nquite happy, you understand, but only in a paralytic sort of way.\\nThe most buoyant exclamations leap up in my heart, but they come\\nout of my mouth quite different. You should hear me say, \\'Buck up,\\nold cock!\\' It would bring tears to your eyes.\"\\n\\n\"It does,\" said Syme; \"but I cannot help thinking that apart from\\nall that you are really a bit worried.\"\\n\\nThe Professor started a little and looked at him steadily.\\n\\n\"You are a very clever fellow,\" he said, \"it is a pleasure to work\\nwith you. Yes, I have rather a heavy cloud in my head. There is a\\ngreat problem to face,\" and he sank his bald brow in his two hands.\\n\\nThen he said in a low voice--\\n\\n\"Can you play the piano?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Syme in simple wonder, \"I\\'m supposed to have a good\\ntouch.\"\\n\\nThen, as the other did not speak, he added--\\n\\n\"I trust the great cloud is lifted.\"\\n\\nAfter a long silence, the Professor said out of the cavernous\\nshadow of his hands--\\n\\n\"It would have done just as well if you could work a typewriter.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said Syme, \"you flatter me.\"\\n\\n\"Listen to me,\" said the other, \"and remember whom we have to see\\ntomorrow. You and I are going tomorrow to attempt something which\\nis very much more dangerous than trying to steal the Crown Jewels\\nout of the Tower. We are trying to steal a secret from a very\\nsharp, very strong, and very wicked man. I believe there is no man,\\nexcept the President, of course, who is so seriously startling and\\nformidable as that little grinning fellow in goggles. He has not\\nperhaps the white-hot enthusiasm unto death, the mad martyrdom for\\nanarchy, which marks the Secretary. But then that very fanaticism\\nin the Secretary has a human pathos, and is almost a redeeming\\ntrait. But the little Doctor has a brutal sanity that is more\\nshocking than the Secretary\\'s disease. Don\\'t you notice his\\ndetestable virility and vitality. He bounces like an india-rubber\\nball. Depend on it, Sunday was not asleep (I wonder if he ever\\nsleeps?) when he locked up all the plans of this outrage in the\\nround, black head of Dr. Bull.\"\\n\\n\"And you think,\" said Syme, \"that this unique monster will be\\nsoothed if I play the piano to him?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be an ass,\" said his mentor. \"I mentioned the piano because\\nit gives one quick and independent fingers. Syme, if we are to go\\nthrough this interview and come out sane or alive, we must have\\nsome code of signals between us that this brute will not see. I\\nhave made a rough alphabetical cypher corresponding to the five\\nfingers--like this, see,\" and he rippled with his fingers on the\\nwooden table--\"B A D, bad, a word we may frequently require.\"\\n\\nSyme poured himself out another glass of wine, and began to study\\nthe scheme. He was abnormally quick with his brains at puzzles,\\nand with his hands at conjuring, and it did not take him long to\\nlearn how he might convey simple messages by what would seem to\\nbe idle taps upon a table or knee. But wine and companionship had\\nalways the effect of inspiring him to a farcical ingenuity, and\\nthe Professor soon found himself struggling with the too vast\\nenergy of the new language, as it passed through the heated brain\\nof Syme.\\n\\n\"We must have several word-signs,\" said Syme seriously--\"words that\\nwe are likely to want, fine shades of meaning. My favourite word is\\n\\'coeval\\'. What\\'s yours?\"\\n\\n\"Do stop playing the goat,\" said the Professor plaintively. \"You\\ndon\\'t know how serious this is.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Lush\\' too,\" said Syme, shaking his head sagaciously, \"we must\\nhave \\'lush\\'--word applied to grass, don\\'t you know?\"\\n\\n\"Do you imagine,\" asked the Professor furiously, \"that we are going\\nto talk to Dr. Bull about grass?\"\\n\\n\"There are several ways in which the subject could be approached,\"\\nsaid Syme reflectively, \"and the word introduced without appearing\\nforced. We might say, \\'Dr. Bull, as a revolutionist, you remember\\nthat a tyrant once advised us to eat grass; and indeed many of us,\\nlooking on the fresh lush grass of summer\"\\'\\n\\n\"Do you understand,\" said the other, \"that this is a tragedy?\"\\n\\n\"Perfectly,\" replied Syme; \"always be comic in a tragedy. What\\nthe deuce else can you do? I wish this language of yours had a\\nwider scope. I suppose we could not extend it from the fingers\\nto the toes? That would involve pulling off our boots and socks\\nduring the conversation, which however unobtrusively performed--\"\\n\\n\"Syme,\" said his friend with a stern simplicity, \"go to bed!\"\\n\\nSyme, however, sat up in bed for a considerable time mastering the\\nnew code. He was awakened next morning while the east was still\\nsealed with darkness, and found his grey-bearded ally standing like\\na ghost beside his bed.\\n\\nSyme sat up in bed blinking; then slowly collected his thoughts,\\nthrew off the bed-clothes, and stood up. It seemed to him in some\\ncurious way that all the safety and sociability of the night before\\nfell with the bedclothes off him, and he stood up in an air of cold\\ndanger. He still felt an entire trust and loyalty towards his\\ncompanion; but it was the trust between two men going to the\\nscaffold.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Syme with a forced cheerfulness as he pulled on his\\ntrousers, \"I dreamt of that alphabet of yours. Did it take you\\nlong to make it up?\"\\n\\nThe Professor made no answer, but gazed in front of him with eyes\\nthe colour of a wintry sea; so Syme repeated his question.\\n\\n\"I say, did it take you long to invent all this? I\\'m considered\\ngood at these things, and it was a good hour\\'s grind. Did you\\nlearn it all on the spot?\"\\n\\nThe Professor was silent; his eyes were wide open, and he wore a\\nfixed but very small smile.\\n\\n\"How long did it take you?\"\\n\\nThe Professor did not move.\\n\\n\"Confound you, can\\'t you answer?\" called out Syme, in a sudden\\nanger that had something like fear underneath. Whether or no the\\nProfessor could answer, he did not.\\n\\nSyme stood staring back at the stiff face like parchment and the\\nblank, blue eyes. His first thought was that the Professor had gone\\nmad, but his second thought was more frightful. After all, what did\\nhe know about this queer creature whom he had heedlessly accepted\\nas a friend? What did he know, except that the man had been at the\\nanarchist breakfast and had told him a ridiculous tale? How\\nimprobable it was that there should be another friend there beside\\nGogol! Was this man\\'s silence a sensational way of declaring war?\\nWas this adamantine stare after all only the awful sneer of some\\nthreefold traitor, who had turned for the last time? He stood and\\nstrained his ears in this heartless silence. He almost fancied he\\ncould hear dynamiters come to capture him shifting softly in the\\ncorridor outside.\\n\\nThen his eye strayed downwards, and he burst out laughing. Though\\nthe Professor himself stood there as voiceless as a statue, his\\nfive dumb fingers were dancing alive upon the dead table. Syme\\nwatched the twinkling movements of the talking hand, and read\\nclearly the message--\\n\\n\"I will only talk like this. We must get used to it.\"\\n\\nHe rapped out the answer with the impatience of relief--\\n\\n\"All right. Let\\'s get out to breakfast.\"\\n\\nThey took their hats and sticks in silence; but as Syme took his\\nsword-stick, he held it hard.\\n\\nThey paused for a few minutes only to stuff down coffee and coarse\\nthick sandwiches at a coffee stall, and then made their way across\\nthe river, which under the grey and growing light looked as\\ndesolate as Acheron. They reached the bottom of the huge block of\\nbuildings which they had seen from across the river, and began in\\nsilence to mount the naked and numberless stone steps, only pausing\\nnow and then to make short remarks on the rail of the banisters. At\\nabout every other flight they passed a window; each window showed\\nthem a pale and tragic dawn lifting itself laboriously over London.\\nFrom each the innumerable roofs of slate looked like the leaden\\nsurges of a grey, troubled sea after rain. Syme was increasingly\\nconscious that his new adventure had somehow a quality of cold\\nsanity worse than the wild adventures of the past. Last night, for\\ninstance, the tall tenements had seemed to him like a tower in a\\ndream. As he now went up the weary and perpetual steps, he was\\ndaunted and bewildered by their almost infinite series. But it was\\nnot the hot horror of a dream or of anything that might be\\nexaggeration or delusion. Their infinity was more like the empty\\ninfinity of arithmetic, something unthinkable, yet necessary to\\nthought. Or it was like the stunning statements of astronomy about\\nthe distance of the fixed stars. He was ascending the house of\\nreason, a thing more hideous than unreason itself.\\n\\nBy the time they reached Dr. Bull\\'s landing, a last window showed\\nthem a harsh, white dawn edged with banks of a kind of coarse red,\\nmore like red clay than red cloud. And when they entered Dr. Bull\\'s\\nbare garret it was full of light.\\n\\nSyme had been haunted by a half historic memory in connection with\\nthese empty rooms and that austere daybreak. The moment he saw the\\ngarret and Dr. Bull sitting writing at a table, he remembered what\\nthe memory was--the French Revolution. There should have been the\\nblack outline of a guillotine against that heavy red and white of\\nthe morning. Dr. Bull was in his white shirt and black breeches\\nonly; his cropped, dark head might well have just come out of its\\nwig; he might have been Marat or a more slipshod Robespierre.\\n\\nYet when he was seen properly, the French fancy fell away. The\\nJacobins were idealists; there was about this man a murderous\\nmaterialism. His Dosition gave him a somewhat new appearance. The\\nstrong, white light of morning coming from one side creating sharp\\nshadows, made him seem both more pale and more angular than he had\\nlooked at the breakfast on the balcony. Thus the two black glasses\\nthat encased his eyes might really have been black cavities in his\\nskull, making him look like a death\\'s-head. And, indeed, if ever\\nDeath himself sat writing at a wooden table, it might have been he.\\n\\nHe looked up and smiled brightly enough as the men came in, and\\nrose with the resilient rapidity of which the Professor had\\nspoken. He set chairs for both of them, and going to a peg behind\\nthe door, proceeded to put on a coat and waistcoat of rough, dark\\ntweed; he buttoned it up neatly, and came back to sit down at his\\ntable.\\n\\nThe quiet good humour of his manner left his two opponents\\nhelpless. It was with some momentary difficulty that the\\nProfessor broke silence and began, \"I\\'m sorry to disturb you so\\nearly, comrade,\" said he, with a careful resumption of the slow\\nde Worms manner. \"You have no doubt made all the arrangements for\\nthe Paris affair?\" Then he added with infinite slowness, \"We have\\ninformation which renders intolerable anything in the nature of a\\nmoment\\'s delay.\"\\n\\nDr. Bull smiled again, but continued to gaze on them without\\nspeaking. The Professor resumed, a pause before each weary word--\\n\\n\"Please do not think me excessively abrupt; but I advise you to\\nalter those plans, or if it is too late for that, to follow your\\nagent with all the support you can get for him. Comrade Syme and\\nI have had an experience which it would take more time to recount\\nthan we can afford, if we are to act on it. I will, however,\\nrelate the occurrence in detail, even at the risk of losing time,\\nif you really feel that it is essential to the understanding of\\nthe problem we have to discuss.\"\\n\\nHe was spinning out his sentences, making them intolerably long\\nand lingering, in the hope of maddening the practical little\\nDoctor into an explosion of impatience which might show his hand.\\nBut the little Doctor continued only to stare and smile, and the\\nmonologue was uphill work. Syme began to feel a new sickness and\\ndespair. The Doctor\\'s smile and silence were not at all like the\\ncataleptic stare and horrible silence which he had confronted in\\nthe Professor half an hour before. About the Professor\\'s makeup\\nand all his antics there was always something merely grotesque,\\nlike a gollywog. Syme remembered those wild woes of yesterday as\\none remembers being afraid of Bogy in childhood. But here was\\ndaylight; here was a healthy, square-shouldered man in tweeds,\\nnot odd save for the accident of his ugly spectacles, not glaring\\nor grinning at all, but smiling steadily and not saying a word.\\nThe whole had a sense of unbearable reality. Under the increasing\\nsunlight the colours of the Doctor\\'s complexion, the pattern of\\nhis tweeds, grew and expanded outrageously, as such things grow\\ntoo important in a realistic novel. But his smile was quite\\nslight, the pose of his head polite; the only uncanny thing was\\nhis silence.\\n\\n\"As I say,\" resumed the Professor, like a man toiling through\\nheavy sand, \"the incident that has occurred to us and has led\\nus to ask for information about the Marquis, is one which you\\nmay think it better to have narrated; but as it came in the\\nway of Comrade Syme rather than me--\"\\n\\nHis words he seemed to be dragging out like words in an anthem;\\nbut Syme, who was watching, saw his long fingers rattle quickly\\non the edge of the crazy table. He read the message, \"You must\\ngo on. This devil has sucked me dry!\"\\n\\nSyme plunged into the breach with that bravado of improvisation\\nwhich always came to him when he was alarmed.\\n\\n\"Yes, the thing really happened to me,\" he said hastily. \"I had\\nthe good fortune to fall into conversation with a detective who\\ntook me, thanks to my hat, for a respectable person. Wishing to\\nclinch my reputation for respectability, I took him and made him\\nvery drunk at the Savoy. Under this influence he became friendly,\\nand told me in so many words that within a day or two they hope\\nto arrest the Marquis in France.\\n\\nSo unless you or I can get on his track--\"\\n\\nThe Doctor was still smiling in the most friendly way, and his\\nprotected eyes were still impenetrable. The Professor signalled to\\nSyme that he would resume his explanation, and he began again with\\nthe same elaborate calm.\\n\\n\"Syme immediately brought this information to me, and we came here\\ntogether to see what use you would be inclined to make of it. It\\nseems to me unquestionably urgent that--\"\\n\\nAll this time Syme had been staring at the Doctor almost as\\nsteadily as the Doctor stared at the Professor, but quite without\\nthe smile. The nerves of both comrades-in-arms were near snapping\\nunder that strain of motionless amiability, when Syme suddenly\\nleant forward and idly tapped the edge of the table. His message\\nto his ally ran, \"I have an intuition.\"\\n\\nThe Professor, with scarcely a pause in his monologue, signalled\\nback, \"Then sit on it.\"\\n\\nSyme telegraphed, \"It is quite extraordinary.\"\\n\\nThe other answered, \"Extraordinary rot!\"\\n\\nSyme said, \"I am a poet.\"\\n\\nThe other retorted, \"You are a dead man.\"\\n\\nSyme had gone quite red up to his yellow hair, and his eyes were\\nburning feverishly. As he said he had an intuition, and it had\\nrisen to a sort of lightheaded certainty. Resuming his symbolic\\ntaps, he signalled to his friend, \"You scarcely realise how poetic\\nmy intuition is. It has that sudden quality we sometimes feel in\\nthe coming of spring.\"\\n\\nHe then studied the answer on his friend\\'s fingers. The answer\\nwas, \"Go to hell! \"\\n\\nThe Professor then resumed his merely verbal monologue addressed\\nto the Doctor.\\n\\n\"Perhaps I should rather say,\" said Syme on his fingers, \"that it\\nresembles that sudden smell of the sea which may be found in the\\nheart of lush woods.\"\\n\\nHis companion disdained to reply.\\n\\n\"Or yet again,\" tapped Syme, \"it is positive, as is the passionate\\nred hair of a beautiful woman.\"\\n\\nThe Professor was continuing his speech, but in the middle of it\\nSyme decided to act. He leant across the table, and said in a\\nvoice that could not be neglected--\\n\\n\"Dr. Bull!\"\\n\\nThe Doctor\\'s sleek and smiling head did not move, but they could\\nhave sworn that under his dark glasses his eyes darted towards\\nSyme.\\n\\n\"Dr. Bull,\" said Syme, in a voice peculiarly precise and\\ncourteous, \"would you do me a small favour? Would you be so kind\\nas to take off your spectacles?\"\\n\\nThe Professor swung round on his seat, and stared at Syme with a\\nsort of frozen fury of astonishment. Syme, like a man who has\\nthrown his life and fortune on the table, leaned forward with a\\nfiery face. The Doctor did not move.\\n\\nFor a few seconds there was a silence in which one could hear a\\npin drop, split once by the single hoot of a distant steamer on\\nthe Thames. Then Dr. Bull rose slowly, still smiling, and took\\noff his spectacles.\\n\\nSyme sprang to his feet, stepping backwards a little, like a\\nchemical lecturer from a successful explosion. His eyes were like\\nstars, and for an instant he could only point without speaking.\\n\\nThe Professor had also started to his feet, forgetful of his\\nsupposed paralysis. He leant on the back of the chair and stared\\ndoubtfully at Dr. Bull, as if the Doctor had been turned into a\\ntoad before his eyes. And indeed it was almost as great a\\ntransformation scene.\\n\\nThe two detectives saw sitting in the chair before them a very\\nboyish-looking young man, with very frank and happy hazel eyes, an\\nopen expression, cockney clothes like those of a city clerk, and\\nan unquestionable breath about him of being very good and rather\\ncommonplace. The smile was still there, but it might have been the\\nfirst smile of a baby.\\n\\n\"I knew I was a poet,\" cried Syme in a sort of ecstasy. \"I knew my\\nintuition was as infallible as the Pope. It was the spectacles that\\ndid it! It was all the spectacles. Given those beastly black eyes,\\nand all the rest of him his health and his jolly looks, made him a\\nlive devil among dead ones.\"\\n\\n\"It certainly does make a queer difference,\" said the Professor\\nshakily. \"But as regards the project of Dr. Bull--\"\\n\\n\"Project be damned!\" roared Syme, beside himself. \"Look at him!\\nLook at his face, look at his collar, look at his blessed boots!\\nYou don\\'t suppose, do you, that that thing\\'s an anarchist?\"\\n\\n\"Syme!\" cried the other in an apprehensive agony.\\n\\n\"Why, by God,\" said Syme, \"I\\'ll take the risk of that myself! Dr.\\nBull, I am a police officer. There\\'s my card,\" and he flung down\\nthe blue card upon the table.\\n\\nThe Professor still feared that all was lost; but he was loyal. He\\npulled out his own official card and put it beside his friend\\'s.\\nThen the third man burst out laughing, and for the first time that\\nmorning they heard his voice.\\n\\n\"I\\'m awfully glad you chaps have come so early,\" he said, with\\na sort of schoolboy flippancy, \"for we can all start for France\\ntogether. Yes, I\\'m in the force right enough,\" and he flicked a\\nblue card towards them lightly as a matter of form.\\n\\nClapping a brisk bowler on his head and resuming his goblin\\nglasses, the Doctor moved so quickly towards the door, that the\\nothers instinctively followed him. Syme seemed a little distrait,\\nand as he passed under the doorway he suddenly struck his stick\\non the stone passage so that it rang.\\n\\n\"But Lord God Almighty,\" he cried out, \"if this is all right, there\\nwere more damned detectives than there were damned dynamiters at\\nthe damned Council!\"\\n\\n\"We might have fought easily,\" said Bull; \"we were four against\\nthree.\"\\n\\nThe Professor was descending the stairs, but his voice came up from\\nbelow.\\n\\n\"No,\" said the voice, \"we were not four against three--we were not\\nso lucky. We were four against One.\"\\n\\nThe others went down the stairs in silence.\\n\\nThe young man called Bull, with an innocent courtesy characteristic\\nof him, insisted on going last until they reached the street; but\\nthere his own robust rapidity asserted itself unconsciously, and he\\nwalked quickly on ahead towards a railway inquiry office, talking\\nto the others over his shoulder.\\n\\n\"It is jolly to get some pals,\" he said. \"I\\'ve been half dead with\\nthe jumps, being quite alone. I nearly flung my arms round Gogol\\nand embraced him, which would have been imprudent. I hope you won\\'t\\ndespise me for having been in a blue funk.\"\\n\\n\"All the blue devils in blue hell,\" said Syme, \"contributed to my\\nblue funk! But the worst devil was you and your infernal goggles.\"\\n\\nThe young man laughed delightedly.\\n\\n\"Wasn\\'t it a rag?\" he said. \"Such a simple idea--not my own. I\\nhaven\\'t got the brains. You see, I wanted to go into the detective\\nservice, especially the anti-dynamite business. But for that\\npurpose they wanted someone to dress up as a dynamiter; and they\\nall swore by blazes that I could never look like a dynamiter. They\\nsaid my very walk was respectable, and that seen from behind I\\nlooked like the British Constitution. They said I looked too\\nhealthy and too optimistic, and too reliable and benevolent; they\\ncalled me all sorts of names at Scotland Yard. They said that if I\\nhad been a criminal, I might have made my fortune by looking so\\nlike an honest man; but as I had the misfortune to be an honest\\nman, there was not even the remotest chance of my assisting them by\\never looking like a criminal. But as last I was brought before some\\nold josser who was high up in the force, and who seemed to have no\\nend of a head on his shoulders. And there the others all talked\\nhopelessly. One asked whether a bushy beard would hide my nice\\nsmile; another said that if they blacked my face I might look like\\na negro anarchist; but this old chap chipped in with a most\\nextraordinary remark. \\'A pair of smoked spectacles will do it,\\' he\\nsaid positively. \\'Look at him now; he looks like an angelic office\\nboy. Put him on a pair of smoked spectacles, and children will\\nscream at the sight of him.\\' And so it was, by George! When once my\\neyes were covered, all the rest, smile and big shoulders and short\\nhair, made me look a perfect little devil. As I say, it was simple\\nenough when it was done, like miracles; but that wasn\\'t the really\\nmiraculous part of it. There was one really staggering thing about\\nthe business, and my head still turns at it.\"\\n\\n\"What was that?\" asked Syme.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you,\" answered the man in spectacles. \"This big pot in\\nthe police who sized me up so that he knew how the goggles would\\ngo with my hair and socks--by God, he never saw me at all!\"\\n\\nSyme\\'s eyes suddenly flashed on him.\\n\\n\"How was that?\" he asked. \"I thought you talked to him.\"\\n\\n\"So I did,\" said Bull brightly; \"but we talked in a pitch-dark\\nroom like a coalcellar. There, you would never have guessed that.\"\\n\\n\"I could not have conceived it,\" said Syme gravely.\\n\\n\"It is indeed a new idea,\" said the Professor.\\n\\nTheir new ally was in practical matters a whirlwind. At the\\ninquiry office he asked with businesslike brevity about the trains\\nfor Dover. Having got his information, he bundled the company into\\na cab, and put them and himself inside a railway carriage before\\nthey had properly realised the breathless process. They were\\nalready on the Calais boat before conversation flowed freely.\\n\\n\"I had already arranged,\" he explained, \"to go to France for my\\nlunch; but I am delighted to have someone to lunch with me. You\\nsee, I had to send that beast, the Marquis, over with his bomb,\\nbecause the President had his eye on me, though God knows how.\\nI\\'ll tell you the story some day. It was perfectly choking.\\nWhenever I tried to slip out of it I saw the President somewhere,\\nsmiling out of the bow-window of a club, or taking off his hat to\\nme from the top of an omnibus. I tell you, you can say what you\\nlike, that fellow sold himself to the devil; he can be in six\\nplaces at once.\"\\n\\n\"So you sent the Marquis off, I understand,\" asked the Professor.\\n\"Was it long ago? Shall we be in time to catch him?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered the new guide, \"I\\'ve timed it all. He\\'ll still be\\nat Calais when we arrive.\"\\n\\n\"But when we do catch him at Calais,\" said the Professor, \"what are\\nwe going to do?\"\\n\\nAt this question the countenance of Dr. Bull fell for the first\\ntime. He reflected a little, and then said--\\n\\n\"Theoretically, I suppose, we ought to call the police.\"\\n\\n\"Not I,\" said Syme. \"Theoretically I ought to drown myself first. I\\npromised a poor fellow, who was a real modern pessimist, on my word\\nof honour not to tell the police. I\\'m no hand at casuistry, but I\\ncan\\'t break my word to a modern pessimist. It\\'s like breaking one\\'s\\nword to a child.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m in the same boat,\" said the Professor. \"I tried to tell the\\npolice and I couldn\\'t, because of some silly oath I took. You see,\\nwhen I was an actor I was a sort of all-round beast. Perjury or\\ntreason is the only crime I haven\\'t committed. If I did that I\\nshouldn\\'t know the difference between right and wrong.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been through all that,\" said Dr. Bull, \"and I\\'ve made up my\\nmind. I gave my promise to the Secretary--you know him, man who\\nsmiles upside down. My friends, that man is the most utterly\\nunhappy man that was ever human. It may be his digestion, or his\\nconscience, or his nerves, or his philosophy of the universe, but\\nhe\\'s damned, he\\'s in hell! Well, I can\\'t turn on a man like that,\\nand hunt him down. It\\'s like whipping a leper. I may be mad, but\\nthat\\'s how I feel; and there\\'s jolly well the end of it.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think you\\'re mad,\" said Syme. \"I knew you would decide\\nlike that when first you--\"\\n\\n\"Eh?\" said Dr. Bull.\\n\\n\"When first you took off your spectacles.\"\\n\\nDr. Bull smiled a little, and strolled across the deck to look at\\nthe sunlit sea. Then he strolled back again, kicking his heels\\ncarelessly, and a companionable silence fell between the three men.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Syme, \"it seems that we have all the same kind of\\nmorality or immorality, so we had better face the fact that comes\\nof it.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" assented the Professor, \"you\\'re quite right; and we must\\nhurry up, for I can see the Grey Nose standing out from France.\"\\n\\n\"The fact that comes of it,\" said Syme seriously, \"is this, that we\\nthree are alone on this planet. Gogol has gone, God knows where;\\nperhaps the President has smashed him like a fly. On the Council we\\nare three men against three, like the Romans who held the bridge.\\nBut we are worse off than that, first because they can appeal to\\ntheir organization and we cannot appeal to ours, and second\\nbecause--\"\\n\\n\"Because one of those other three men,\" said the Professor, \"is not\\na man.\"\\n\\nSyme nodded and was silent for a second or two, then he said--\\n\\n\"My idea is this. We must do something to keep the Marquis in\\nCalais till tomorrow midday. I have turned over twenty schemes in\\nmy head. We cannot denounce him as a dynamiter; that is agreed. We\\ncannot get him detained on some trivial charge, for we should have\\nto appear; he knows us, and he would smell a rat. We cannot pretend\\nto keep him on anarchist business; he might swallow much in that\\nway, but not the notion of stopping in Calais while the Czar went\\nsafely through Paris. We might try to kidnap him, and lock him up\\nourselves; but he is a well-known man here. He has a whole\\nbodyguard of friends; he is very strong and brave, and the event is\\ndoubtful. The only thing I can see to do is actually to take\\nadvantage of the very things that are in the Marquis\\'s favour. I am\\ngoing to profit by the fact that he is a highly respected nobleman.\\nI am going to profit by the fact that he has many friends and moves\\nin the best society.\"\\n\\n\"What the devil are you talking about?\" asked the Professor.\\n\\n\"The Symes are first mentioned in the fourteenth century,\" said\\nSyme; \"but there is a tradition that one of them rode behind Bruce\\nat Bannockburn. Since 1350 the tree is quite clear.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s gone off his head,\" said the little Doctor, staring.\\n\\n\"Our bearings,\" continued Syme calmly, \"are \\'argent a chevron gules\\ncharged with three cross crosslets of the field.\\' The motto\\nvaries.\"\\n\\nThe Professor seized Syme roughly by the waistcoat.\\n\\n\"We are just inshore,\" he said. \"Are you seasick or joking in the\\nwrong place?\"\\n\\n\"My remarks are almost painfully practical,\" answered Syme, in an\\nunhurried manner. \"The house of St. Eustache also is very ancient.\\nThe Marquis cannot deny that he is a gentleman. He cannot deny\\nthat I am a gentleman. And in order to put the matter of my social\\nposition quite beyond a doubt, I propose at the earliest\\nopportunity to knock his hat off. But here we are in the harbour.\"\\n\\nThey went on shore under the strong sun in a sort of daze. Syme,\\nwho had now taken the lead as Bull had taken it in London, led\\nthem along a kind of marine parade until he came to some cafes,\\nembowered in a bulk of greenery and overlooking the sea. As he\\nwent before them his step was slightly swaggering, and he swung\\nhis stick like a sword. He was making apparently for the extreme\\nend of the line of cafes, but he stopped abruptly. With a sharp\\ngesture he motioned them to silence, but he pointed with one\\ngloved finger to a cafe table under a bank of flowering foliage\\nat which sat the Marquis de St. Eustache, his teeth shining in\\nhis thick, black beard, and his bold, brown face shadowed by a\\nlight yellow straw hat and outlined against the violet sea.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nTHE DUEL\\n\\nSYME sat down at a cafe table with his companions, his blue eyes\\nsparkling like the bright sea below, and ordered a bottle of\\nSaumur with a pleased impatience. He was for some reason in a\\ncondition of curious hilarity. His spirits were already\\nunnaturally high; they rose as the Saumur sank, and in half an\\nhour his talk was a torrent of nonsense. He professed to be\\nmaking out a plan of the conversation which was going to ensue\\nbetween himself and the deadly Marquis. He jotted it down wildly\\nwith a pencil. It was arranged like a printed catechism, with\\nquestions and answers, and was delivered with an extraordinary\\nrapidity of utterance.\\n\\n\"I shall approach. Before taking off his hat, I shall take off my\\nown. I shall say, \\'The Marquis de Saint Eustache, I believe.\\' He\\nwill say, \\'The celebrated Mr. Syme, I presume.\\' He will say in the\\nmost exquisite French, \\'How are you?\\' I shall reply in the most\\nexquisite Cockney, \\'Oh, just the Syme--\\' \"\\n\\n\"Oh, shut it,\" said the man in spectacles. \"Pull yourself\\ntogether, and chuck away that bit of paper. What are you really\\ngoing to do?\"\\n\\n\"But it was a lovely catechism,\" said Syme pathetically. \"Do let\\nme read it you. It has only forty-three questions and answers, and\\nsome of the Marquis\\'s answers are wonderfully witty. I like to be\\njust to my enemy.\"\\n\\n\"But what\\'s the good of it all?\" asked Dr. Bull in exasperation.\\n\\n\"It leads up to my challenge, don\\'t you see,\" said Syme, beaming.\\n\"When the Marquis has given the thirty-ninth reply, which runs--\"\\n\\n\"Has it by any chance occurred to you,\" asked the Professor, with\\na ponderous simplicity, \"that the Marquis may not say all the\\nforty-three things you have put down for him? In that case, I\\nunderstand, your own epigrams may appear somewhat more forced.\"\\n\\nSyme struck the table with a radiant face.\\n\\n\"Why, how true that is,\" he said, \"and I never thought of it. Sir,\\nyou have an intellect beyond the common. You will make a name.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'re as drunk as an owl!\" said the Doctor.\\n\\n\"It only remains,\" continued Syme quite unperturbed, \"to adopt\\nsome other method of breaking the ice (if I may so express it)\\nbetween myself and the man I wish to kill. And since the course of\\na dialogue cannot be predicted by one of its parties alone (as you\\nhave pointed out with such recondite acumen), the only thing to be\\ndone, I suppose, is for the one party, as far as possible, to do\\nall the dialogue by himself. And so I will, by George!\" And he\\nstood up suddenly, his yellow hair blowing in the slight sea\\nbreeze.\\n\\nA band was playing in a cafe chantant hidden somewhere among the\\ntrees, and a woman had just stopped singing. On Syme\\'s heated head\\nthe bray of the brass band seemed like the jar and jingle of that\\nbarrel-organ in Leicester Square, to the tune of which he had once\\nstood up to die. He looked across to the little table where the\\nMarquis sat. The man had two companions now, solemn Frenchmen in\\nfrock-coats and silk hats, one of them with the red rosette of the\\nLegion of Honour, evidently people of a solid social position.\\nBesides these black, cylindrical costumes, the Marquis, in his\\nloose straw hat and light spring clothes, looked Bohemian and even\\nbarbaric; but he looked the Marquis. Indeed, one might say that he\\nlooked the king, with his animal elegance, his scornful eyes, and\\nhis proud head lifted against the purple sea. But he was no\\nChristian king, at any rate; he was, rather, some swarthy despot,\\nhalf Greek, half Asiatic, who in the days when slavery seemed\\nnatural looked down on the Mediterranean, on his galley and his\\ngroaning slaves. Just so, Syme thought, would the brown-gold face\\nof such a tyrant have shown against the dark green olives and the\\nburning blue.\\n\\n\"Are you going to address the meeting?\" asked the Professor\\npeevishly, seeing that Syme still stood up without moving.\\n\\nSyme drained his last glass of sparkling wine.\\n\\n\"I am,\" he said, pointing across to the Marquis and his companions,\\n\"that meeting. That meeting displeases me. I am going to pull that\\nmeeting\\'s great ugly, mahogany-coloured nose.\"\\n\\nHe stepped across swiftly, if not quite steadily. The Marquis,\\nseeing him, arched his black Assyrian eyebrows in surprise, but\\nsmiled politely.\\n\\n\"You are Mr. Syme, I think,\" he said.\\n\\nSyme bowed.\\n\\n\"And you are the Marquis de Saint Eustache,\" he said gracefully.\\n\"Permit me to pull your nose.\"\\n\\nHe leant over to do so, but the Marquis started backwards,\\nupsetting his chair, and the two men in top hats held Syme back\\nby the shoulders.\\n\\n\"This man has insulted me!\" said Syme, with gestures of\\nexplanation.\\n\\n\"Insulted you?\" cried the gentleman with the red rosette, \"when?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, just now,\" said Syme recklessly. \"He insulted my mother.\"\\n\\n\"Insulted your mother!\" exclaimed the gentleman incredulously.\\n\\n\"Well, anyhow,\" said Syme, conceding a point, \"my aunt.\"\\n\\n\"But how can the Marquis have insulted your aunt just now?\" said\\nthe second gentleman with some legitimate wonder. \"He has been\\nsitting here all the time.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, it was what he said!\" said Syme darkly.\\n\\n\"I said nothing at all,\" said the Marquis, \"except something\\nabout the band. I only said that I liked Wagner played well.\"\\n\\n\"It was an allusion to my family,\" said Syme firmly. \"My aunt\\nplayed Wagner badly. It was a painful subject. We are always\\nbeing insulted about it.\"\\n\\n\"This seems most extraordinary,\" said the gentleman who was\\ndecore, looking doubtfully at the Marquis.\\n\\n\"Oh, I assure you,\" said Syme earnestly, \"the whole of your\\nconversation was simply packed with sinister allusions to my\\naunt\\'s weaknesses.\"\\n\\n\"This is nonsense!\" said the second gentleman. \"I for one have\\nsaid nothing for half an hour except that I liked the singing of\\nthat girl with black hair.\"\\n\\n\"Well, there you are again!\" said Syme indignantly. \"My aunt\\'s was\\nred.\"\\n\\n\"It seems to me,\" said the other, \"that you are simply seeking a\\npretext to insult the Marquis.\"\\n\\n\"By George!\" said Syme, facing round and looking at him, \"what a\\nclever chap you are!\"\\n\\nThe Marquis started up with eyes flaming like a tiger\\'s.\\n\\n\"Seeking a quarrel with me!\" he cried. \"Seeking a fight with me! By\\nGod! there was never a man who had to seek long. These gentlemen\\nwill perhaps act for me. There are still four hours of daylight.\\nLet us fight this evening.\"\\n\\nSyme bowed with a quite beautiful graciousness.\\n\\n\"Marquis,\" he said, \"your action is worthy of your fame and blood.\\nPermit me to consult for a moment with the gentlemen in whose\\nhands I shall place myself.\"\\n\\nIn three long strides he rejoined his companions, and they, who\\nhad seen his champagne-inspired attack and listened to his idiotic\\nexplanations, were quite startled at the look of him. For now that\\nhe came back to them he was quite sober, a little pale, and he\\nspoke in a low voice of passionate practicality.\\n\\n\"I have done it,\" he said hoarsely. \"I have fixed a fight on the\\nbeast. But look here, and listen carefully. There is no time for\\ntalk. You are my seconds, and everything must come from you. Now\\nyou must insist, and insist absolutely, on the duel coming off\\nafter seven tomorrow, so as to give me the chance of preventing him\\nfrom catching the 7.45 for Paris. If he misses that he misses his\\ncrime. He can\\'t refuse to meet you on such a small point of time\\nand place. But this is what he will do. He will choose a field\\nsomewhere near a wayside station, where he can pick up the train.\\nHe is a very good swordsman, and he will trust to killing me in\\ntime to catch it. But I can fence well too, and I think I can keep\\nhim in play, at any rate, until the train is lost. Then perhaps he\\nmay kill me to console his feelings. You understand? Very well\\nthen, let me introduce you to some charming friends of mine,\" and\\nleading them quickly across the parade, he presented them to the\\nMarquis\\'s seconds by two very aristocratic names of which they had\\nnot previously heard.\\n\\nSyme was subject to spasms of singular common sense, not otherwise\\na part of his character. They were (as he said of his impulse about\\nthe spectacles) poetic intuitions, and they sometimes rose to the\\nexaltation of prophecy.\\n\\nHe had correctly calculated in this case the policy of his\\nopponent. When the Marquis was informed by his seconds that Syme\\ncould only fight in the morning, he must fully have realised that\\nan obstacle had suddenly arisen between him and his bomb-throwing\\nbusiness in the capital. Naturally he could not explain this\\nobjection to his friends, so he chose the course which Syme had\\npredicted. He induced his seconds to settle on a small meadow not\\nfar from the railway, and he trusted to the fatality of the first\\nengagement.\\n\\nWhen he came down very coolly to the field of honour, no one could\\nhave guessed that he had any anxiety about a journey; his hands\\nwere in his pockets, his straw hat on the back of his head, his\\nhandsome face brazen in the sun. But it might have struck a\\nstranger as odd that there appeared in his train, not only his\\nseconds carrying the sword-case, but two of his servants carrying\\na portmanteau and a luncheon basket.\\n\\nEarly as was the hour, the sun soaked everything in warmth, and\\nSyme was vaguely surprised to see so many spring flowers burning\\ngold and silver in the tall grass in which the whole company stood\\nalmost knee-deep.\\n\\nWith the exception of the Marquis, all the men were in sombre and\\nsolemn morning-dress, with hats like black chimney-pots; the little\\nDoctor especially, with the addition of his black spectacles,\\nlooked like an undertaker in a farce. Syme could not help feeling a\\ncomic contrast between this funereal church parade of apparel and\\nthe rich and glistening meadow, growing wild flowers everywhere.\\nBut, indeed, this comic contrast between the yellow blossoms and\\nthe black hats was but a symbol of the tragic contrast between the\\nyellow blossoms and the black business. On his right was a little\\nwood; far away to his left lay the long curve of the railway line,\\nwhich he was, so to speak, guarding from the Marquis, whose goal\\nand escape it was. In front of him, behind the black group of his\\nopponents, he could see, like a tinted cloud, a small almond bush\\nin flower against the faint line of the sea.\\n\\nThe member of the Legion of Honour, whose name it seemed was\\nColonel Ducroix, approached the Professor and Dr. Bull with great\\npoliteness, and suggested that the play should terminate with the\\nfirst considerable hurt.\\n\\nDr. Bull, however, having been carefully coached by Syme upon this\\npoint of policy, insisted, with great dignity and in very bad\\nFrench, that it should continue until one of the combatants was\\ndisabled. Syme had made up his mind that he could avoid disabling\\nthe Marquis and prevent the Marquis from disabling him for at\\nleast twenty minutes. In twenty minutes the Paris train would have\\ngone by.\\n\\n\"To a man of the well-known skill and valour of Monsieur de St.\\nEustache,\" said the Professor solemnly, \"it must be a matter of\\nindifference which method is adopted, and our principal has strong\\nreasons for demanding the longer encounter, reasons the delicacy\\nof which prevent me from being explicit, but for the just and\\nhonourable nature of which I can--\"\\n\\n\"Peste!\" broke from the Marquis behind, whose face had suddenly\\ndarkened, \"let us stop talking and begin,\" and he slashed off the\\nhead of a tall flower with his stick.\\n\\nSyme understood his rude impatience and instinctively looked over\\nhis shoulder to see whether the train was coming in sight. But\\nthere was no smoke on the horizon.\\n\\nColonel Ducroix knelt down and unlocked the case, taking out a\\npair of twin swords, which took the sunlight and turned to two\\nstreaks of white fire. He offered one to the Marquis, who snatched\\nit without ceremony, and another to Syme, who took it, bent it,\\nand poised it with as much delay as was consistent with dignity.\\n\\nThen the Colonel took out another pair of blades, and taking one\\nhimself and giving another to Dr. Bull, proceeded to place the\\nmen.\\n\\nBoth combatants had thrown off their coats and waistcoats, and\\nstood sword in hand. The seconds stood on each side of the line\\nof fight with drawn swords also, but still sombre in their dark\\nfrock-coats and hats. The principals saluted. The Colonel said\\nquietly, \"Engage!\" and the two blades touched and tingled.\\n\\nWhen the jar of the joined iron ran up Syme\\'s arm, all the\\nfantastic fears that have been the subject of this story fell\\nfrom him like dreams from a man waking up in bed. He remembered\\nthem clearly and in order as mere delusions of the nerves--how\\nthe fear of the Professor had been the fear of the tyrannic\\naccidents of nightmare, and how the fear of the Doctor had been\\nthe fear of the airless vacuum of science. The first was the old\\nfear that any miracle might happen, the second the more hopeless\\nmodern fear that no miracle can ever happen. But he saw that\\nthese fears were fancies, for he found himself in the presence of\\nthe great fact of the fear of death, with its coarse and pitiless\\ncommon sense. He felt like a man who had dreamed all night of\\nfalling over precipices, and had woke up on the morning when he\\nwas to be hanged. For as soon as he had seen the sunlight run\\ndown the channel of his foe\\'s foreshortened blade, and as soon as\\nhe had felt the two tongues of steel touch, vibrating like two\\nliving things, he knew that his enemy was a terrible fighter, and\\nthat probably his last hour had come.\\n\\nHe felt a strange and vivid value in all the earth around him, in\\nthe grass under his feet; he felt the love of life in all living\\nthings. He could almost fancy that he heard the grass growing; he\\ncould almost fancy that even as he stood fresh flowers were\\nspringing up and breaking into blossom in the meadow--flowers blood\\nred and burning gold and blue, fulfilling the whole pageant of the\\nspring. And whenever his eyes strayed for a flash from the calm,\\nstaring, hypnotic eyes of the Marquis, they saw the little tuft of\\nalmond tree against the sky-line. He had the feeling that if by\\nsome miracle he escaped he would be ready to sit for ever before\\nthat almond tree, desiring nothing else in the world.\\n\\nBut while earth and sky and everything had the living beauty of a\\nthing lost, the other half of his head was as clear as glass, and\\nhe was parrying his enemy\\'s point with a kind of clockwork skill of\\nwhich he had hardly supposed himself capable. Once his enemy\\'s\\npoint ran along his wrist, leaving a slight streak of blood, but it\\neither was not noticed or was tacitly ignored. Every now and then\\nhe riposted, and once or twice he could almost fancy that he felt\\nhis point go home, but as there was no blood on blade or shirt he\\nsupposed he was mistaken. Then came an interruption and a change.\\n\\nAt the risk of losing all, the Marquis, interrupting his quiet\\nstare, flashed one glance over his shoulder at the line of railway\\non his right. Then he turned on Syme a face transfigured to that of\\na fiend, and began to fight as if with twenty weapons. The attack\\ncame so fast and furious, that the one shining sword seemed a\\nshower of shining arrows. Syme had no chance to look at the\\nrailway; but also he had no need. He could guess the reason of the\\nMarquis\\'s sudden madness of battle--the Paris train was in sight.\\n\\nBut the Marquis\\'s morbid energy over-reached itself. Twice Syme,\\nparrying, knocked his opponent\\'s point far out of the fighting\\ncircle; and the third time his riposte was so rapid, that there\\nwas no doubt about the hit this time. Syme\\'s sword actually bent\\nunder the weight of the Marquis\\'s body, which it had pierced.\\n\\nSyme was as certain that he had stuck his blade into his enemy as\\na gardener that he has stuck his spade into the ground. Yet the\\nMarquis sprang back from the stroke without a stagger, and Syme\\nstood staring at his own sword-point like an idiot. There was no\\nblood on it at all.\\n\\nThere was an instant of rigid silence, and then Syme in his turn\\nfell furiously on the other, filled with a flaming curiosity. The\\nMarquis was probably, in a general sense, a better fencer than he,\\nas he had surmised at the beginning, but at the moment the Marquis\\nseemed distraught and at a disadvantage. He fought wildly and even\\nweakly, and he constantly looked away at the railway line, almost\\nas if he feared the train more than the pointed steel. Syme, on the\\nother hand, fought fiercely but still carefully, in an intellectual\\nfury, eager to solve the riddle of his own bloodless sword. For\\nthis purpose, he aimed less at the Marquis\\'s body, and more at his\\nthroat and head. A minute and a half afterwards he felt his point\\nenter the man\\'s neck below the jaw. It came out clean. Half mad, he\\nthrust again, and made what should have been a bloody scar on the\\nMarquis\\'s cheek. But there was no scar.\\n\\nFor one moment the heaven of Syme again grew black with\\nsupernatural terrors. Surely the man had a charmed life. But this\\nnew spiritual dread was a more awful thing than had been the mere\\nspiritual topsy-turvydom symbolised by the paralytic who pursued\\nhim. The Professor was only a goblin; this man was a devil--perhaps\\nhe was the Devil! Anyhow, this was certain, that three times had a\\nhuman sword been driven into him and made no mark. When Syme had\\nthat thought he drew himself up, and all that was good in him sang\\nhigh up in the air as a high wind sings in the trees. He thought of\\nall the human things in his story--of the Chinese lanterns in\\nSaffron Park, of the girl\\'s red hair in the garden, of the honest,\\nbeer-swilling sailors down by the dock, of his loyal companions\\nstanding by. Perhaps he had been chosen as a champion of all these\\nfresh and kindly things to cross swords with the enemy of all\\ncreation. \"After all,\" he said to himself, \"I am more than a devil;\\nI am a man. I can do the one thing which Satan himself cannot do--I\\ncan die,\" and as the word went through his head, he heard a faint\\nand far-off hoot, which would soon be the roar of the Paris train.\\n\\nHe fell to fighting again with a supernatural levity, like a\\nMohammedan panting for Paradise. As the train came nearer and\\nnearer he fancied he could see people putting up the floral\\narches in Paris; he joined in the growing noise and the glory of\\nthe great Republic whose gate he was guarding against Hell. His\\nthoughts rose higher and higher with the rising roar of the\\ntrain, which ended, as if proudly, in a long and piercing\\nwhistle. The train stopped.\\n\\nSuddenly, to the astonishment of everyone the Marquis sprang back\\nquite out of sword reach and threw down his sword. The leap was\\nwonderful, and not the less wonderful because Syme had plunged his\\nsword a moment before into the man\\'s thigh.\\n\\n\"Stop!\" said the Marquis in a voice that compelled a momentary\\nobedience. \"I want to say something.\"\\n\\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Colonel Ducroix, staring. \"Has there\\nbeen foul play?\"\\n\\n\"There has been foul play somewhere,\" said Dr. Bull, who was a\\nlittle pale. \"Our principal has wounded the Marquis four times\\nat least, and he is none the worse .\"\\n\\nThe Marquis put up his hand with a curious air of ghastly\\npatience.\\n\\n\"Please let me speak,\" he said. \"It is rather important. Mr.\\nSyme,\" he continued, turning to his opponent, \"we are fighting\\ntoday, if I remember right, because you expressed a wish (which\\nI thought irrational) to pull my nose. Would you oblige me by\\npulling my nose now as quickly as possible? I have to catch a\\ntrain.\"\\n\\n\"I protest that this is most irregular,\" said Dr. Bull\\nindignantly.\\n\\n\"It is certainly somewhat opposed to precedent,\" said Colonel\\nDucroix, looking wistfully at his principal. \"There is, I think,\\none case on record (Captain Bellegarde and the Baron Zumpt) in\\nwhich the weapons were changed in the middle of the encounter at\\nthe request of one of the combatants. But one can hardly call\\none\\'s nose a weapon.\"\\n\\n\"Will you or will you not pull my nose?\" said the Marquis in\\nexasperation. \"Come, come, Mr. Syme! You wanted to do it, do it!\\nYou can have no conception of how important it is to me. Don\\'t be\\nso selfish! Pull my nose at once, when I ask you!\" and he bent\\nslightly forward with a fascinating smile. The Paris train,\\npanting and groaning, had grated into a little station behind the\\nneighbouring hill.\\n\\nSyme had the feeling he had more than once had in these adventures\\n--the sense that a horrible and sublime wave lifted to heaven was\\njust toppling over. Walking in a world he half understood, he took\\ntwo paces forward and seized the Roman nose of this remarkable\\nnobleman. He pulled it hard, and it came off in his hand.\\n\\nHe stood for some seconds with a foolish solemnity, with the\\npasteboard proboscis still between his fingers, looking at it,\\nwhile the sun and the clouds and the wooded hills looked down\\nupon this imbecile scene.\\n\\nThe Marquis broke the silence in a loud and cheerful voice.\\n\\n\"If anyone has any use for my left eyebrow,\" he said, \"he can have\\nit. Colonel Ducroix, do accept my left eyebrow! It\\'s the kind of\\nthing that might come in useful any day,\" and he gravely tore off\\none of his swarthy Assyrian brows, bringing about half his brown\\nforehead with it, and politely offered it to the Colonel, who\\nstood crimson and speechless with rage.\\n\\n\"If I had known,\" he spluttered, \"that I was acting for a poltroon\\nwho pads himself to fight--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I know, I know!\" said the Marquis, recklessly throwing various\\nparts of himself right and left about the field. \"You are making a\\nmistake; but it can\\'t be explained just now. I tell you the train\\nhas come into the station!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Dr. Bull fiercely, \"and the train shall go out of the\\nstation. It shall go out without you. We know well enough for what\\ndevil\\'s work--\"\\n\\nThe mysterious Marquis lifted his hands with a desperate gesture.\\nHe was a strange scarecrow standing there in the sun with half his\\nold face peeled off, and half another face glaring and grinning\\nfrom underneath.\\n\\n\"Will you drive me mad?\" he cried. \"The train--\"\\n\\n\"You shall not go by the train,\" said Syme firmly, and grasped his\\nsword.\\n\\nThe wild figure turned towards Syme, and seemed to be gathering\\nitself for a sublime effort before speaking.\\n\\n\"You great fat, blasted, blear-eyed, blundering, thundering,\\nbrainless, Godforsaken, doddering, damned fool!\" he said without\\ntaking breath. \"You great silly, pink-faced, towheaded turnip!\\nYou--\"\\n\\n\"You shall not go by this train,\" repeated Syme.\\n\\n\"And why the infernal blazes,\" roared the other, \"should I want to\\ngo by the train?\"\\n\\n\"We know all,\" said the Professor sternly. \"You are going to Paris\\nto throw a bomb!\"\\n\\n\"Going to Jericho to throw a Jabberwock!\" cried the other, tearing\\nhis hair, which came off easily.\\n\\n\"Have you all got softening of the brain, that you don\\'t realise\\nwhat I am? Did you really think I wanted to catch that train?\\nTwenty Paris trains might go by for me. Damn Paris trains!\"\\n\\n\"Then what did you care about?\" began the Professor.\\n\\n\"What did I care about? I didn\\'t care about catching the train; I\\ncared about whether the train caught me, and now, by God! it has\\ncaught me.\"\\n\\n\"I regret to inform you,\" said Syme with restraint, \"that your\\nremarks convey no impression to my mind. Perhaps if you were to\\nremove the remains of your original forehead and some portion of\\nwhat was once your chin, your meaning would become clearer. Mental\\nlucidity fulfils itself in many ways. What do you mean by saying\\nthat the train has caught you? It may be my literary fancy, but\\nsomehow I feel that it ought to mean something.\"\\n\\n\"It means everything,\" said the other, \"and the end of everything.\\nSunday has us now in the hollow of his hand.\"\\n\\n\"Us!\" repeated the Professor, as if stupefied. \"What do you mean by\\n\\'us\\'?\"\\n\\n\"The police, of course!\" said the Marquis, and tore off his scalp\\nand half his face.\\n\\nThe head which emerged was the blonde, well brushed, smooth-haired\\nhead which is common in the English constabulary, but the face was\\nterribly pale.\\n\\n\"I am Inspector Ratcliffe,\" he said, with a sort of haste that\\nverged on harshness. \"My name is pretty well known to the police,\\nand I can see well enough that you belong to them. But if there is\\nany doubt about my position, I have a card\" and he began to pull a\\nblue card from his pocket.\\n\\nThe Professor gave a tired gesture.\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t show it us,\" he said wearily; \"we\\'ve got enough of them\\nto equip a paper-chase.\"\\n\\nThe little man named Bull, had, like many men who seem to be of a\\nmere vivacious vulgarity, sudden movements of good taste. Here he\\ncertainly saved the situation. In the midst of this staggering\\ntransformation scene he stepped forward with all the gravity and\\nresponsibility of a second, and addressed the two seconds of the\\nMarquis.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"we all owe you a serious apology; but I\\nassure you that you have not been made the victims of such a low\\njoke as you imagine, or indeed of anything undignified in a man of\\nhonour. You have not wasted your time; you have helped to save the\\nworld. We are not buffoons, but very desperate men at war with a\\nvast conspiracy. A secret society of anarchists is hunting us like\\nhares; not such unfortunate madmen as may here or there throw a\\nbomb through starvation or German philosophy, but a rich and\\npowerful and fanatical church, a church of eastern pessimism, which\\nholds it holy to destroy mankind like vermin. How hard they hunt us\\nyou can gather from the fact that we are driven to such disguises\\nas those for which I apologise, and to such pranks as this one by\\nwhich you suffer. \"\\n\\nThe younger second of the Marquis, a short man with a black\\nmoustache, bowed politely, and said--\\n\\n\"Of course, I accept the apology; but you will in your turn forgive\\nme if I decline to follow you further into your difficulties, and\\npermit myself to say good morning! The sight of an acquaintance and\\ndistinguished fellow-townsman coming to pieces in the open air is\\nunusual, and, upon the whole, sufficient for one day. Colonel\\nDucroix, I would in no way influence your actions, but if you feel\\nwith me that our present society is a little abnormal, I am now\\ngoing to walk back to the town.\"\\n\\nColonel Ducroix moved mechanically, but then tugged abruptly at his\\nwhite moustache and broke out--\\n\\n\"No, by George! I won\\'t. If these gentlemen are really in a mess\\nwith a lot of low wreckers like that, I\\'ll see them through it. I\\nhave fought for France, and it is hard if I can\\'t fight for\\ncivilization.\"\\n\\nDr. Bull took off his hat and waved it, cheering as at a public\\nmeeting.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t make too much noise,\" said Inspector Ratcliffe, \"Sunday may\\nhear you.\"\\n\\n\"Sunday!\" cried Bull, and dropped his hat.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" retorted Ratcliffe, \"he may be with them.\"\\n\\n\"With whom?\" asked Syme.\\n\\n\"With the people out of that train,\" said the other.\\n\\n\"What you say seems utterly wild,\" began Syme. \"Why, as a matter of\\nfact--But, my God,\" he cried out suddenly, like a man who sees an\\nexplosion a long way off, \"by God! if this is true the whole bally\\nlot of us on the Anarchist Council were against anarchy! Every born\\nman was a detective except the President and his personal\\nsecretary. What can it mean?\"\\n\\n\"Mean!\" said the new policeman with incredible violence. \"It means\\nthat we are struck dead! Don\\'t you know Sunday? Don\\'t you know that\\nhis jokes are always so big and simple that one has never thought\\nof them? Can you think of anything more like Sunday than this, that\\nhe should put all his powerful enemies on the Supreme Council, and\\nthen take care that it was not supreme? I tell you he has bought\\nevery trust, he has captured every cable, he has control of every\\nrailway line--especially of that railway line!\" and he pointed a\\nshaking finger towards the small wayside station. \"The whole\\nmovement was controlled by him; half the world was ready to rise\\nfor him. But there were just five people, perhaps, who would have\\nresisted him . . . and the old devil put them on the Supreme\\nCouncil, to waste their time in watching each other. Idiots that\\nwe are, he planned the whole of our idiocies! Sunday knew that the\\nProfessor would chase Syme through London, and that Syme would\\nfight me in France. And he was combining great masses of capital,\\nand seizing great lines of telegraphy, while we five idiots were\\nrunning after each other like a lot of confounded babies playing\\nblind man\\'s buff.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\" asked Syme with a sort of steadiness.\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied the other with sudden serenity, \"he has found us\\nplaying blind man\\'s buff today in a field of great rustic beauty\\nand extreme solitude. He has probably captured the world; it only\\nremains to him to capture this field and all the fools in it. And\\nsince you really want to know what was my objection to the arrival\\nof that train, I will tell you. My objection was that Sunday or his\\nSecretary has just this moment got out of it.\"\\n\\nSyme uttered an involuntary cry, and they all turned their eyes\\ntowards the far-off station. It was quite true that a considerable\\nbulk of people seemed to be moving in their direction. But they\\nwere too distant to be distinguished in any way.\\n\\n\"It was a habit of the late Marquis de St. Eustache,\" said the new\\npoliceman, producing a leather case, \"always to carry a pair of\\nopera glasses. Either the President or the Secretary is coming\\nafter us with that mob. They have caught us in a nice quiet place\\nwhere we are under no temptations to break our oaths by calling\\nthe police. Dr. Bull, I have a suspicion that you will see better\\nthrough these than through your own highly decorative spectacles.\"\\n\\nHe handed the field-glasses to the Doctor, who immediately took\\noff his spectacles and put the apparatus to his eyes.\\n\\n\"It cannot be as bad as you say,\" said the Professor, somewhat\\nshaken. \"There are a good number of them certainly, but they may\\neasily be ordinary tourists.\"\\n\\n\"Do ordinary tourists,\" asked Bull, with the fieldglasses to his\\neyes, \"wear black masks half-way down the face?\"\\n\\nSyme almost tore the glasses out of his hand, and looked through\\nthem. Most men in the advancing mob really looked ordinary enough;\\nbut it was quite true that two or three of the leaders in front\\nwore black half-masks almost down to their mouths. This disguise\\nis very complete, especially at such a distance, and Syme found\\nit impossible to conclude anything from the clean-shaven jaws and\\nchins of the men talking in the front. But presently as they\\ntalked they all smiled and one of them smiled on one side.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\nTHE CRIMINALS CHASE THE POLICE\\n\\nSYME put the field-glasses from his eyes with an almost ghastly\\nrelief.\\n\\n\"The President is not with them, anyhow,\" he said, and wiped his\\nforehead.\\n\\n\"But surely they are right away on the horizon,\" said the\\nbewildered Colonel, blinking and but half recovered from Bull\\'s\\nhasty though polite explanation. \"Could you possibly know your\\nPresident among all those people?\"\\n\\n\"Could I know a white elephant among all those people!\" answered\\nSyme somewhat irritably. \"As you very truly say, they are on the\\nhorizon; but if he were walking with them . . . by God! I believe\\nthis ground would shake.\"\\n\\nAfter an instant\\'s pause the new man called Ratcliffe said with\\ngloomy decision--\\n\\n\"Of course the President isn\\'t with them. I wish to Gemini he were.\\nMuch more likely the President is riding in triumph through Paris,\\nor sitting on the ruins of St. Paul\\'s Cathedral.\"\\n\\n\"This is absurd!\" said Syme. \"Something may have happened in our\\nabsence; but he cannot have carried the world with a rush like\\nthat. It is quite true,\" he added, frowning dubiously at the\\ndistant fields that lay towards the little station, \"it is\\ncertainly true that there seems to be a crowd coming this way;\\nbut they are not all the army that you make out.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, they,\" said the new detective contemptuously; \"no they are\\nnot a very valuable force. But let me tell you frankly that they\\nare precisely calculated to our value--we are not much, my boy,\\nin Sunday\\'s universe. He has got hold of all the cables and\\ntelegraphs himself. But to kill the Supreme Council he regards as\\na trivial matter, like a post card; it may be left to his private\\nsecretary,\" and he spat on the grass.\\n\\nThen he turned to the others and said somewhat austerely--\\n\\n\"There is a great deal to be said for death; but if anyone has\\nany preference for the other alternative, I strongly advise him\\nto walk after me.\"\\n\\nWith these words, he turned his broad back and strode with silent\\nenergy towards the wood. The others gave one glance over their\\nshoulders, and saw that the dark cloud of men had detached itself\\nfrom the station and was moving with a mysterious discipline\\nacross the plain. They saw already, even with the naked eye, black\\nblots on the foremost faces, which marked the masks they wore.\\nThey turned and followed their leader, who had already struck the\\nwood, and disappeared among the twinkling trees.\\n\\nThe sun on the grass was dry and hot. So in plunging into the wood\\nthey had a cool shock of shadow, as of divers who plunge into a\\ndim pool. The inside of the wood was full of shattered sunlight\\nand shaken shadows. They made a sort of shuddering veil, almost\\nrecalling the dizziness of a cinematograph. Even the solid figures\\nwalking with him Syme could hardly see for the patterns of sun and\\nshade that danced upon them. Now a man\\'s head was lit as with a\\nlight of Rembrandt, leaving all else obliterated; now again he had\\nstrong and staring white hands with the face of a negro. The\\nex-Marquis had pulled the old straw hat over his eyes, and the\\nblack shade of the brim cut his face so squarely in two that it\\nseemed to be wearing one of the black half-masks of their pursuers.\\nThe fancy tinted Syme\\'s overwhelming sense of wonder. Was he\\nwearing a mask? Was anyone wearing a mask? Was anyone anything?\\nThis wood of witchery, in which men\\'s faces turned black and white\\nby turns, in which their figures first swelled into sunlight and\\nthen faded into formless night, this mere chaos of chiaroscuro\\n(after the clear daylight outside), seemed to Syme a perfect symbol\\nof the world in which he had been moving for three days, this world\\nwhere men took off their beards and their spectacles and their\\nnoses, and turned into other people. That tragic self-confidence\\nwhich he had felt when he believed that the Marquis was a devil\\nhad strangely disappeared now that he knew that the Marquis was\\na friend. He felt almost inclined to ask after all these\\nbewilderments what was a friend and what an enemy. Was there\\nanything that was apart from what it seemed? The Marquis had taken\\noff his nose and turned out to be a detective. Might he not just\\nas well take off his head and turn out to be a hobgoblin? Was not\\neverything, after all, like this bewildering woodland, this dance\\nof dark and light? Everything only a glimpse, the glimpse always\\nunforeseen, and always forgotten. For Gabriel Syme had found in\\nthe heart of that sun-splashed wood what many modern painters had\\nfound there. He had found the thing which the modern people call\\nImpressionism, which is another name for that final scepticism\\nwhich can find no floor to the universe.\\n\\nAs a man in an evil dream strains himself to scream and wake, Syme\\nstrove with a sudden effort to fling off this last and worst of\\nhis fancies. With two impatient strides he overtook the man in the\\nMarquis\\'s straw hat, the man whom he had come to address as\\nRatcliffe. In a voice exaggeratively loud and cheerful, he broke\\nthe bottomless silence and made conversation.\\n\\n\"May I ask,\" he said, \"where on earth we are all going to? \"\\n\\nSo genuine had been the doubts of his soul, that he was quite glad\\nto hear his companion speak in an easy, human voice.\\n\\n\"We must get down through the town of Lancy to the sea,\" he said.\\n\"I think that part of the country is least likely to be with\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"What can you mean by all this?\" cried Syme. \"They can\\'t be\\nrunning the real world in that way. Surely not many working men\\nare anarchists, and surely if they were, mere mobs could not beat\\nmodern armies and police.\"\\n\\n\"Mere mobs!\" repeated his new friend with a snort of scorn. \"So\\nyou talk about mobs and the working classes as if they were the\\nquestion. You\\'ve got that eternal idiotic idea that if anarchy\\ncame it would come from the poor. Why should it? The poor have\\nbeen rebels, but they have never been anarchists; they have more\\ninterest than anyone else in there being some decent government.\\nThe poor man really has a stake in the country. The rich man\\nhasn\\'t; he can go away to New Guinea in a yacht. The poor have\\nsometimes objected to being governed badly; the rich have always\\nobjected to being governed at all. Aristocrats were always\\nanarchists, as you can see from the barons\\' wars.\"\\n\\n\"As a lecture on English history for the little ones,\" said Syme,\\n\"this is all very nice; but I have not yet grasped its application.\"\\n\\n\"Its application is,\" said his informant, \"that most of old Sunday\\'s\\nright-hand men are South African and American millionaires. That is\\nwhy he has got hold of all the communications; and that is why the\\nlast four champions of the anti-anarchist police force are running\\nthrough a wood like rabbits.\"\\n\\n\"Millionaires I can understand,\" said Syme thoughtfully, \"they are\\nnearly all mad. But getting hold of a few wicked old gentlemen with\\nhobbies is one thing; getting hold of great Christian nations is\\nanother. I would bet the nose off my face (forgive the allusion)\\nthat Sunday would stand perfectly helpless before the task of\\nconverting any ordinary healthy person anywhere.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the other, \"it rather depends what sort of person you\\nmean.\"\\n\\n\"Well, for instance,\" said Syme, \"he could never convert that\\nperson,\" and he pointed straight in front of him.\\n\\nThey had come to an open space of sunlight, which seemed to express\\nto Syme the final return of his own good sense; and in the middle\\nof this forest clearing was a figure that might well stand for that\\ncommon sense in an almost awful actuality. Burnt by the sun and\\nstained with perspiration, and grave with the bottomless gravity of\\nsmall necessary toils, a heavy French peasant was cutting wood with\\na hatchet. His cart stood a few yards off, already half full of\\ntimber; and the horse that cropped the grass was, like his master,\\nvalorous but not desperate; like his master, he was even\\nprosperous, but yet was almost sad. The man was a Norman, taller\\nthan the average of the French and very angular; and his swarthy\\nfigure stood dark against a square of sunlight, almost like some\\nallegoric figure of labour frescoed on a ground of gold.\\n\\n\"Mr. Syme is saying,\" called out Ratcliffe to the French Colonel,\\n\"that this man, at least, will never be an anarchist.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Syme is right enough there,\" answered Colonel Ducroix,\\nlaughing, \"if only for the reason that he has plenty of property\\nto defend. But I forgot that in your country you are not used to\\npeasants being wealthy.\"\\n\\n\"He looks poor,\" said Dr. Bull doubtfully.\\n\\n\"Quite so,\" said the Colonel; \"that is why he is rich.\"\\n\\n\"I have an idea,\" called out Dr. Bull suddenly; \"how much would he\\ntake to give us a lift in his cart? Those dogs are all on foot, and\\nwe could soon leave them behind.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, give him anything!\" said Syme eagerly. \"I have piles of money\\non me.\"\\n\\n\"That will never do,\" said the Colonel; \"he will never have any\\nrespect for you unless you drive a bargain.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, if he haggles!\" began Bull impatiently.\\n\\n\"Erie haggles because he is a free man,\" said the other. \"You do\\nnot understand; he would not see the meaning of generosity. He is\\nnot being tipped.\"\\n\\nAnd even while they seemed to hear the heavy feet of their strange\\npursuers behind them, they had to stand and stamp while the French\\nColonel talked to the French wood-cutter with all the leisurely\\nbadinage and bickering of market-day. At the end of the four\\nminutes, however, they saw that the Colonel was right, for the\\nwood-cutter entered into their plans, not with the vague servility\\nof a tout too-well paid, but with the seriousness of a solicitor\\nwho had been paid the proper fee. He told them that the best thing\\nthey could do was to make their way down to the little inn on the\\nhills above Lancy, where the innkeeper, an old soldier who had\\nbecome devot in his latter years, would be certain to sympathise\\nwith them, and even to take risks in their support. The whole\\ncompany, therefore, piled themselves on top of the stacks of wood,\\nand went rocking in the rude cart down the other and steeper side\\nof the woodland. Heavy and ramshackle as was the vehicle, it was\\ndriven quickly enough, and they soon had the exhilarating\\nimpression of distancing altogether those, whoever they were, who\\nwere hunting them. For, after all, the riddle as to where the\\nanarchists had got all these followers was still unsolved. One\\nman\\'s presence had sufficed for them; they had fled at the first\\nsight of the deformed smile of the Secretary. Syme every now and\\nthen looked back over his shoulder at the army on their track.\\n\\nAs the wood grew first thinner and then smaller with distance, he\\ncould see the sunlit slopes beyond it and above it; and across\\nthese was still moving the square black mob like one monstrous\\nbeetle. In the very strong sunlight and with his own very strong\\neyes, which were almost telescopic, Syme could see this mass of\\nmen quite plainly. He could see them as separate human figures;\\nbut he was increasingly surprised by the way in which they moved\\nas one man. They seemed to be dressed in dark clothes and plain\\nhats, like any common crowd out of the streets; but they did not\\nspread and sprawl and trail by various lines to the attack, as\\nwould be natural in an ordinary mob. They moved with a sort of\\ndreadful and wicked woodenness, like a staring army of automatons.\\n\\nSyme pointed this out to Ratcliffe.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied the policeman, \"that\\'s discipline. That\\'s Sunday. He\\nis perhaps five hundred miles off, but the fear of him is on all of\\nthem, like the finger of God. Yes, they are walking regularly; and\\nyou bet your boots that they are talking regularly, yes, and\\nthinking regularly. But the one important thing for us is that they\\nare disappearing regularly.\"\\n\\nSyme nodded. It was true that the black patch of the pursuing men\\nwas growing smaller and smaller as the peasant belaboured his\\nhorse.\\n\\nThe level of the sunlit landscape, though flat as a whole, fell\\naway on the farther side of the wood in billows of heavy slope\\ntowards the sea, in a way not unlike the lower slopes of the\\nSussex downs. The only difference was that in Sussex the road\\nwould have been broken and angular like a little brook, but\\nhere the white French road fell sheer in front of them like a\\nwaterfall. Down this direct descent the cart clattered at a\\nconsiderable angle, and in a few minutes, the road growing yet\\nsteeper, they saw below them the little harbour of Lancy and a\\ngreat blue arc of the sea. The travelling cloud of their enemies\\nhad wholly disappeared from the horizon.\\n\\nThe horse and cart took a sharp turn round a clump of elms, and\\nthe horse\\'s nose nearly struck the face of an old gentleman who\\nwas sitting on the benches outside the little cafe of \"Le Soleil\\nd\\'Or.\" The peasant grunted an apology, and got down from his\\nseat. The others also descended one by one, and spoke to the old\\ngentleman with fragmentary phrases of courtesy, for it was quite\\nevident from his expansive manner that he was the owner of the\\nlittle tavern.\\n\\nHe was a white-haired, apple-faced old boy, with sleepy eyes and\\na grey moustache; stout, sedentary, and very innocent, of a type\\nthat may often be found in France, but is still commoner in\\nCatholic Germany. Everything about him, his pipe, his pot of beer,\\nhis flowers, and his beehive, suggested an ancestral peace; only\\nwhen his visitors looked up as they entered the inn-parlour, they\\nsaw the sword upon the wall.\\n\\nThe Colonel, who greeted the innkeeper as an old friend, passed\\nrapidly into the inn-parlour, and sat down ordering some ritual\\nrefreshment. The military decision of his action interested Syme,\\nwho sat next to him, and he took the opportunity when the old\\ninnkeeper had gone out of satisfying his curiosity.\\n\\n\"May I ask you, Colonel,\" he said in a low voice, \"why we have\\ncome here?\"\\n\\nColonel Ducroix smiled behind his bristly white moustache.\\n\\n\"For two reasons, sir,\" he said; \"and I will give first, not the\\nmost important, but the most utilitarian. We came here because\\nthis is the only place within twenty miles in which we can get\\nhorses.\"\\n\\n\"Horses!\" repeated Syme, looking up quickly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied the other; \"if you people are really to distance\\nyour enemies it is horses or nothing for you, unless of course\\nyou have bicycles and motor-cars in your pocket.\"\\n\\n\"And where do you advise us to make for?\" asked Syme doubtfully.\\n\\n\"Beyond question,\" replied the Colonel, \"you had better make all\\nhaste to the police station beyond the town. My friend, whom I\\nseconded under somewhat deceptive circumstances, seems to me to\\nexaggerate very much the possibilities of a general rising; but\\neven he would hardly maintain, I suppose, that you were not safe\\nwith the gendarmes.\"\\n\\nSyme nodded gravely; then he said abruptly--\\n\\n\"And your other reason for coming here?\"\\n\\n\"My other reason for coming here,\" said Ducroix soberly, \"is that\\nit is just as well to see a good man or two when one is possibly\\nnear to death.\"\\n\\nSyme looked up at the wall, and saw a crudely-painted and pathetic\\nreligious picture. Then he said--\\n\\n\"You are right,\" and then almost immediately afterwards, \"Has\\nanyone seen about the horses?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered Ducroix, \"you may be quite certain that I gave\\norders the moment I came in. Those enemies of yours gave no\\nimpression of hurry, but they were really moving wonderfully fast,\\nlike a well-trained army. I had no idea that the anarchists had so\\nmuch discipline. You have not a moment to waste.\"\\n\\nAlmost as he spoke, the old innkeeper with the blue eyes and white\\nhair came ambling into the room, and announced that six horses\\nwere saddled outside.\\n\\nBy Ducroix\\'s advice the five others equipped themselves with some\\nportable form of food and wine, and keeping their duelling swords\\nas the only weapons available, they clattered away down the steep,\\nwhite road. The two servants, who had carried the Marquis\\'s\\nluggage when he was a marquis, were left behind to drink at the\\ncafe by common consent, and not at all against their own\\ninclination.\\n\\nBy this time the afternoon sun was slanting westward, and by its\\nrays Syme could see the sturdy figure of the old innkeeper growing\\nsmaller and smaller, but still standing and looking after them\\nquite silently, the sunshine in his silver hair. Syme had a fixed,\\nsuperstitious fancy, left in his mind by the chance phrase of the\\nColonel, that this was indeed, perhaps, the last honest stranger\\nwhom he should ever see upon the earth.\\n\\nHe was still looking at this dwindling figure, which stood as a\\nmere grey blot touched with a white flame against the great green\\nwall of the steep down behind him. And as he stared over the top\\nof the down behind the innkeeper, there appeared an army of\\nblack-clad and marching men. They seemed to hang above the good\\nman and his house like a black cloud of locusts. The horses had\\nbeen saddled none too soon.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nTHE EARTH IN ANARCHY\\n\\nURGING the horses to a gallop, without respect to the rather\\nrugged descent of the road, the horsemen soon regained their\\nadvantage over the men on the march, and at last the bulk of the\\nfirst buildings of Lancy cut off the sight of their pursuers.\\nNevertheless, the ride had been a long one, and by the time they\\nreached the real town the west was warming with the colour and\\nquality of sunset. The Colonel suggested that, before making\\nfinally for the police station, they should make the effort, in\\npassing, to attach to themselves one more individual who might be\\nuseful.\\n\\n\"Four out of the five rich men in this town,\" he said, \"are common\\nswindlers. I suppose the proportion is pretty equal all over the\\nworld. The fifth is a friend of mine, and a very fine fellow; and\\nwhat is even more important from our point of view, he owns a\\nmotor-car.\"\\n\\n\"I am afraid,\" said the Professor in his mirthful way, looking\\nback along the white road on which the black, crawling patch might\\nappear at any moment, \"I am afraid we have hardly time for\\nafternoon calls.\"\\n\\n\"Doctor Renard\\'s house is only three minutes off,\" said the\\nColonel.\\n\\n\"Our danger,\" said Dr. Bull, \"is not two minutes off.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Syme, \"if we ride on fast we must leave them behind,\\nfor they are on foot.\"\\n\\n\"He has a motor-car,\" said the Colonel.\\n\\n\"But we may not get it,\" said Bull.\\n\\n\"Yes, he is quite on your side.\"\\n\\n\"But he might be out.\"\\n\\n\"Hold your tongue,\" said Syme suddenly. \"What is that noise?\"\\n\\nFor a second they all sat as still as equestrian statues, and\\nfor a second--for two or three or four seconds--heaven and earth\\nseemed equally still. Then all their ears, in an agony of\\nattention, heard along the road that indescribable thrill and\\nthrob that means only one thing--horses!\\n\\nThe Colonel\\'s face had an instantaneous change, as if lightning\\nhad struck it, and yet left it scatheless.\\n\\n\"They have done us,\" he said, with brief military irony. \"Prepare\\nto receive cavalry!\"\\n\\n\"Where can they have got the horses?\" asked Syme, as he\\nmechanically urged his steed to a canter.\\n\\nThe Colonel was silent for a little, then he said in a strained\\nvoice--\\n\\n\"I was speaking with strict accuracy when I said that the \\'Soleil\\nd\\'Or\\' was the only place where one can get horses within twenty\\nmiles.\"\\n\\n\"No!\" said Syme violently, \"I don\\'t believe he\\'d do it. Not with\\nall that white hair.\"\\n\\n\"He may have been forced,\" said the Colonel gently. \"They must be\\nat least a hundred strong, for which reason we are all going to\\nsee my friend Renard, who has a motor-car.\"\\n\\nWith these words he swung his horse suddenly round a street\\ncorner, and went down the street with such thundering speed, that\\nthe others, though already well at the gallop, had difficulty in\\nfollowing the flying tail of his horse.\\n\\nDr. Renard inhabited a high and comfortable house at the top of a\\nsteep street, so that when the riders alighted at his door they\\ncould once more see the solid green ridge of the hill, with the\\nwhite road across it, standing up above all the roofs of the town.\\nThey breathed again to see that the road as yet was clear, and they\\nrang the bell.\\n\\nDr. Renard was a beaming, brown-bearded man, a good example of that\\nsilent but very busy professional class which France has preserved\\neven more perfectly than England. When the matter was explained to\\nhim he pooh-poohed the panic of the ex-Marquis altogether; he said,\\nwith the solid French scepticism, that there was no conceivable\\nprobability of a general anarchist rising. \"Anarchy,\" he said,\\nshrugging his shoulders, \"it is childishness!\"\\n\\n\"Et ca,\" cried out the Colonel suddenly, pointing over the other\\'s\\nshoulder, \"and that is childishness, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\nThey all looked round, and saw a curve of black cavalry come\\nsweeping over the top of the hill with all the energy of Attila.\\nSwiftly as they rode, however, the whole rank still kept well\\ntogether, and they could see the black vizards of the first line\\nas level as a line of uniforms. But although the main black\\nsquare was the same, though travelling faster, there was now one\\nsensational difference which they could see clearly upon the slope\\nof the hill, as if upon a slanted map. The bulk of the riders were\\nin one block; but one rider flew far ahead of the column, and with\\nfrantic movements of hand and heel urged his horse faster and\\nfaster, so that one might have fancied that he was not the pursuer\\nbut the pursued. But even at that great distance they could see\\nsomething so fanatical, so unquestionable in his figure, that they\\nknew it was the Secretary himself. \"I am sorry to cut short a\\ncultured discussion,\" said the Colonel, \"but can you lend me your\\nmotor-car now, in two minutes?\"\\n\\n\"I have a suspicion that you are all mad,\" said Dr. Renard, smiling\\nsociably; \"but God forbid that madness should in any way interrupt\\nfriendship. Let us go round to the garage.\"\\n\\nDr. Renard was a mild man with monstrous wealth; his rooms were\\nlike the Musee de Cluny, and he had three motor-cars. These,\\nhowever, he seemed to use very sparingly, having the simple tastes\\nof the French middle class, and when his impatient friends came to\\nexamine them, it took them some time to assure themselves that one\\nof them even could be made to work. This with some difficulty they\\nbrought round into the street before the Doctor\\'s house. When they\\ncame out of the dim garage they were startled to find that\\ntwilight had already fallen with the abruptness of night in the\\ntropics. Either they had been longer in the place than they\\nimagined, or some unusual canopy of cloud had gathered over the\\ntown. They looked down the steep streets, and seemed to see a\\nslight mist coming up from the sea.\\n\\n\"It is now or never,\" said Dr. Bull. \"I hear horses.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" corrected the Professor, \"a horse.\"\\n\\nAnd as they listened, it was evident that the noise, rapidly\\ncoming nearer on the rattling stones, was not the noise of the\\nwhole cavalcade but that of the one horseman, who had left it\\nfar behind--the insane Secretary.\\n\\nSyme\\'s family, like most of those who end in the simple life, had\\nonce owned a motor, and he knew all about them. He had leapt at\\nonce into the chauffeur\\'s seat, and with flushed face was wrenching\\nand tugging at the disused machinery. He bent his strength upon one\\nhandle, and then said quite quietly--\\n\\n\"I am afraid it\\'s no go.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke, there swept round the corner a man rigid on his\\nrushing horse, with the rush and rigidity of an arrow. He had a\\nsmile that thrust out his chin as if it were dislocated. He swept\\nalongside of the stationary car, into which its company had\\ncrowded, and laid his hand on the front. It was the Secretary,\\nand his mouth went quite straight in the solemnity of triumph.\\n\\nSyme was leaning hard upon the steering wheel, and there was no\\nsound but the rumble of the other pursuers riding into the town.\\nThen there came quite suddenly a scream of scraping iron, and the\\ncar leapt forward. It plucked the Secretary clean out of his\\nsaddle, as a knife is whipped out of its sheath, trailed him\\nkicking terribly for twenty yards, and left him flung flat upon\\nthe road far in front of his frightened horse. As the car took\\nthe corner of the street with a splendid curve, they could just\\nsee the other anarchists filling the street and raising their\\nfallen leader.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t understand why it has grown so dark,\" said the Professor\\nat last in a low voice.\\n\\n\"Going to be a storm, I think,\" said Dr. Bull. \"I say, it\\'s a pity\\nwe haven\\'t got a light on this car, if only to see by.\"\\n\\n\"We have,\" said the Colonel, and from the floor of the car he\\nfished up a heavy, old-fashioned, carved iron lantern with a light\\ninside it. It was obviously an antique, and it would seem as if\\nits original use had been in some way semi-religious, for there\\nwas a rude moulding of a cross upon one of its sides.\\n\\n\"Where on earth did you get that?\" asked the Professor.\\n\\n\"I got it where I got the car,\" answered the Colonel, chuckling,\\n\"from my best friend. While our friend here was fighting with the\\nsteering wheel, I ran up the front steps of the house and spoke to\\nRenard, who was standing in his own porch, you will remember. \\'I\\nsuppose,\\' I said, \\'there\\'s no time to get a lamp.\\' He looked up,\\nblinking amiably at the beautiful arched ceiling of his own front\\nhall. From this was suspended, by chains of exquisite ironwork,\\nthis lantern, one of the hundred treasures of his treasure house.\\nBy sheer force he tore the lamp out of his own ceiling, shattering\\nthe painted panels, and bringing down two blue vases with his\\nviolence. Then he handed me the iron lantern, and I put it in the\\ncar. Was I not right when I said that Dr. Renard was worth\\nknowing?\"\\n\\n\"You were,\" said Syme seriously, and hung the heavy lantern over\\nthe front. There was a certain allegory of their whole position\\nin the contrast between the modern automobile and its strange\\necclesiastical lamp. Hitherto they had passed through the quietest\\npart of the town, meeting at most one or two pedestrians, who could\\ngive them no hint of the peace or the hostility of the place. Now,\\nhowever, the windows in the houses began one by one to be lit up,\\ngiving a greater sense of habitation and humanity. Dr. Bull turned\\nto the new detective who had led their flight, and permitted\\nhimself one of his natural and friendly smiles.\\n\\n\"These lights make one feel more cheerful.\"\\n\\nInspector Ratcliffe drew his brows together.\\n\\n\"There is only one set of lights that make me more cheerful,\" he\\nsaid, \"and they are those lights of the police station which I can\\nsee beyond the town. Please God we may be there in ten minutes.\"\\n\\nThen all Bull\\'s boiling good sense and optimism broke suddenly out\\nof him.\\n\\n\"Oh, this is all raving nonsense!\" he cried. \"If you really think\\nthat ordinary people in ordinary houses are anarchists, you must be\\nmadder than an anarchist yourself. If we turned and fought these\\nfellows, the whole town would fight for us.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said the other with an immovable simplicity, \"the whole town\\nwould fight for them. We shall see.\\'\\n\\nWhile they were speaking the Professor had leant forward with\\nsudden excitement.\\n\\n\"What is that noise?\" he said.\\n\\n\"Oh, the horses behind us, I suppose,\" said the Colonel. \"I thought\\nwe had got clear of them.\"\\n\\n\"The horses behind us! No,\" said the Professor, \"it is not horses,\\nand it is not behind us.\"\\n\\nAlmost as he spoke, across the end of the street before them two\\nshining and rattling shapes shot past. They were gone almost in a\\nflash, but everyone could see that they were motor-cars, and the\\nProfessor stood up with a pale face and swore that they were the\\nother two motor-cars from Dr. Renard\\'s garage.\\n\\n\"I tell you they were his,\" he repeated, with wild eyes, \"and they\\nwere full of men in masks!\"\\n\\n\"Absurd!\" said the Colonel angrily. \"Dr. Renard would never give\\nthem his cars.\"\\n\\n\"He may have been forced,\" said Ratcliffe quietly. \"The whole town\\nis on their side.\"\\n\\n\"You still believe that,\" asked the Colonel incredulously.\\n\\n\"You will all believe it soon,\" said the other with a hopeless\\ncalm.\\n\\nThere was a puzzled pause for some little time, and then the\\nColonel began again abruptly--\\n\\n\"No, I can\\'t believe it. The thing is nonsense. The plain people of\\na peaceable French town--\"\\n\\nHe was cut short by a bang and a blaze of light, which seemed close\\nto his eyes. As the car sped on it left a floating patch of white\\nsmoke behind it, and Syme had heard a shot shriek past his ear.\\n\\n\"My God!\" said the Colonel, \"someone has shot at us.\"\\n\\n\"It need not interrupt conversation,\" said the gloomy Ratcliffe.\\n\"Pray resume your remarks, Colonel. You were talking, I think,\\nabout the plain people of a peaceable French town.\"\\n\\nThe staring Colonel was long past minding satire. He rolled his\\neyes all round the street.\\n\\n\"It is extraordinary,\" he said, \"most extraordinary.\"\\n\\n\"A fastidious person,\" said Syme, \"might even call it unpleasant.\\nHowever, I suppose those lights out in the field beyond this street\\nare the Gendarmerie. We shall soon get there.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Inspector Ratcliffe, \"we shall never get there.\"\\n\\nHe had been standing up and looking keenly ahead of him. Now he sat\\ndown and smoothed his sleek hair with a weary gesture.\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Bull sharply.\\n\\n\"I mean that we shall never get there,\" said the pessimist\\nplacidly. \"They have two rows of armed men across the road already;\\nI can see them from here. The town is in arms, as I said it was.\\n\\nI can only wallow in the exquisite comfort of my own exactitude.\"\\n\\nAnd Ratcliffe sat down comfortably in the car and lit a cigarette,\\nbut the others rose excitedly and stared down the road. Syme had\\nslowed down the car as their plans became doubtful, and he brought\\nit finally to a standstill just at the corner of a side street\\nthat ran down very steeply to the sea.\\n\\nThe town was mostly in shadow, but the sun had not sunk; wherever\\nits level light could break through, it painted everything a\\nburning gold. Up this side street the last sunset light shone as\\nsharp and narrow as the shaft of artificial light at the theatre.\\nIt struck the car of the five friends, and lit it like a burning\\nchariot. But the rest of the street, especially the two ends of\\nit, was in the deepest twilight, and for some seconds they could\\nsee nothing. Then Syme, whose eyes were the keenest, broke into a\\nlittle bitter whistle, and said\\n\\n\"It is quite true. There is a crowd or an army or some such thing\\nacross the end of that street.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if there is,\" said Bull impatiently, \"it must be something\\nelse--a sham fight or the mayor\\'s birthday or something. I cannot\\nand will not believe that plain, jolly people in a place like this\\nwalk about with dynamite in their pockets. Get on a bit, Syme, and\\nlet us look at them.\"\\n\\nThe car crawled about a hundred yards farther, and then they were\\nall startled by Dr. Bull breaking into a high crow of laughter.\\n\\n\"Why, you silly mugs!\" he cried, \"what did I tell you. That\\ncrowd\\'s as law-abiding as a cow, and if it weren\\'t, it\\'s on our\\nside.\"\\n\\n\"How do you know?\" asked the professor, staring.\\n\\n\"You blind bat,\" cried Bull, \"don\\'t you see who is leading them?\"\\n\\nThey peered again, and then the Colonel, with a catch in his\\nvoice, cried out--\\n\\n\"Why, it\\'s Renard!\"\\n\\nThere was, indeed, a rank of dim figures running across the road,\\nand they could not be clearly seen; but far enough in front to\\ncatch the accident of the evening light was stalking up and down\\nthe unmistakable Dr. Renard, in a white hat, stroking his long\\nbrown beard, and holding a revolver in his left hand.\\n\\n\"What a fool I\\'ve been!\" exclaimed the Colonel. \"Of course, the\\ndear old boy has turned out to help us.\"\\n\\nDr. Bull was bubbling over with laughter, swinging the sword in\\nhis hand as carelessly as a cane. He jumped out of the car and\\nran across the intervening space, calling out--\\n\\n\"Dr. Renard! Dr. Renard!\"\\n\\nAn instant after Syme thought his own eyes had gone mad in his\\nhead. For the philanthropic Dr. Renard had deliberately raised his\\nrevolver and fired twice at Bull, so that the shots rang down the\\nroad.\\n\\nAlmost at the same second as the puff of white cloud went up from\\nthis atrocious explosion a long puff of white cloud went up also\\nfrom the cigarette of the cynical Ratcliffe. Like all the rest he\\nturned a little pale, but he smiled. Dr. Bull, at whom the bullets\\nhad been fired, just missing his scalp, stood quite still in the\\nmiddle of the road without a sign of fear, and then turned very\\nslowly and crawled back to the car, and climbed in with two holes\\nthrough his hat.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the cigarette smoker slowly, \"what do you think now?\"\\n\\n\"I think,\" said Dr. Bull with precision, \"that I am lying in bed\\nat No. 217 Peabody Buildings, and that I shall soon wake up with a\\njump; or, if that\\'s not it, I think that I am sitting in a small\\ncushioned cell in Hanwell, and that the doctor can\\'t make much of\\nmy case. But if you want to know what I don\\'t think, I\\'ll tell you.\\nI don\\'t think what you think. I don\\'t think, and I never shall\\nthink, that the mass of ordinary men are a pack of dirty modern\\nthinkers. No, sir, I\\'m a democrat, and I still don\\'t believe that\\nSunday could convert one average navvy or counter-jumper. No, I may\\nbe mad, but humanity isn\\'t.\"\\n\\nSyme turned his bright blue eyes on Bull with an earnestness which\\nhe did not commonly make clear.\\n\\n\"You are a very fine fellow,\" he said. \"You can believe in a sanity\\nwhich is not merely your sanity. And you\\'re right enough about\\nhumanity, about peasants and people like that jolly old innkeeper.\\nBut you\\'re not right about Renard. I suspected him from the first.\\nHe\\'s rationalistic, and, what\\'s worse, he\\'s rich. When duty and\\nreligion are really destroyed, it will be by the rich.\"\\n\\n\"They are really destroyed now,\" said the man with a cigarette, and\\nrose with his hands in his pockets. \"The devils are coming on!\"\\n\\nThe men in the motor-car looked anxiously in the direction of his\\ndreamy gaze, and they saw that the whole regiment at the end of the\\nroad was advancing upon them, Dr. Renard marching furiously in\\nfront, his beard flying in the breeze.\\n\\nThe Colonel sprang out of the car with an intolerant exclamation.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" he cried, \"the thing is incredible. It must be a\\npractical joke. If you knew Renard as I do--it\\'s like calling Queen\\nVictoria a dynamiter. If you had got the man\\'s character into your\\nhead--\"\\n\\n\"Dr. Bull,\" said Syme sardonically, \"has at least got it into his\\nhat.\"\\n\\n\"I tell you it can\\'t be!\" cried the Colonel, stamping.\\n\\n\"Renard shall explain it. He shall explain it to me,\" and he strode\\nforward.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be in such a hurry,\" drawled the smoker. \"He will very soon\\nexplain it to all of us.\"\\n\\nBut the impatient Colonel was already out of earshot, advancing\\ntowards the advancing enemy. The excited Dr. Renard lifted his\\npistol again, but perceiving his opponent, hesitated, and the\\nColonel came face to face with him with frantic gestures of\\nremonstrance.\\n\\n\"It is no good,\" said Syme. \"He will never get anything out of that\\nold heathen. I vote we drive bang through the thick of them, bang\\nas the bullets went through Bull\\'s hat. We may all be killed, but\\nwe must kill a tidy number of them.\"\\n\\n\"I won\\'t \\'ave it,\" said Dr. Bull, growing more vulgar in the\\nsincerity of his virtue. \"The poor chaps may be making a mistake.\\nGive the Colonel a chance.\"\\n\\n\"Shall we go back, then?\" asked the Professor.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ratcliffe in a cold voice, \"the street behind us is held\\ntoo. In fact, I seem to see there another friend of yours, Syme.\"\\n\\nSyme spun round smartly, and stared backwards at the track which\\nthey had travelled. He saw an irregular body of horsemen gathering\\nand galloping towards them in the gloom. He saw above the foremost\\nsaddle the silver gleam of a sword, and then as it grew nearer the\\nsilver gleam of an old man\\'s hair. The next moment, with shattering\\nviolence, he had swung the motor round and sent it dashing down the\\nsteep side street to the sea, like a man that desired only to die.\\n\\n\"What the devil is up?\" cried the Professor, seizing his arm.\\n\\n\"The morning star has fallen!\" said Syme, as his own car went down\\nthe darkness like a falling star.\\n\\nThe others did not understand his words, but when they looked back\\nat the street above they saw the hostile cavalry coming round the\\ncorner and down the slopes after them; and foremost of all rode the\\ngood innkeeper, flushed with the fiery innocence of the evening\\nlight.\\n\\n\"The world is insane!\" said the Professor, and buried his face in\\nhis hands.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Dr. Bull in adamantine humility, \"it is I.\"\\n\\n\"What are we going to do?\" asked the Professor.\\n\\n\"At this moment,\" said Syme, with a scientific detachment, \"I think\\nwe are going to smash into a lamppost.\"\\n\\nThe next instant the automobile had come with a catastrophic jar\\nagainst an iron object. The instant after that four men had crawled\\nout from under a chaos of metal, and a tall lean lamp-post that had\\nstood up straight on the edge of the marine parade stood out, bent\\nand twisted, like the branch of a broken tree.\\n\\n\"Well, we smashed something,\" said the Professor, with a faint\\nsmile. \"That\\'s some comfort.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re becoming an anarchist,\" said Syme, dusting his clothes\\nwith his instinct of daintiness.\\n\\n\"Everyone is,\" said Ratcliffe.\\n\\nAs they spoke, the white-haired horseman and his followers came\\nthundering from above, and almost at the same moment a dark string\\nof men ran shouting along the sea-front. Syme snatched a sword,\\nand took it in his teeth; he stuck two others under his arm-pits,\\ntook a fourth in his left hand and the lantern in his right, and\\nleapt off the high parade on to the beach below.\\n\\nThe others leapt after him, with a common acceptance of such\\ndecisive action, leaving the debris and the gathering mob above\\nthem.\\n\\n\"We have one more chance,\" said Syme, taking the steel out of his\\nmouth. \"Whatever all this pandemonium means, I suppose the police\\nstation will help us. We can\\'t get there, for they hold the way.\\nBut there\\'s a pier or breakwater runs out into the sea just here,\\nwhich we could defend longer than anything else, like Horatius and\\nhis bridge. We must defend it till the Gendarmerie turn out. Keep\\nafter me.\"\\n\\nThey followed him as he went crunching down the beach, and in a\\nsecond or two their boots broke not on the sea gravel, but on\\nbroad, flat stones. They marched down a long, low jetty, running\\nout in one arm into the dim, boiling sea, and when they came to\\nthe end of it they felt that they had come to the end of their\\nstory. They turned and faced the town.\\n\\nThat town was transfigured with uproar. All along the high parade\\nfrom which they had just descended was a dark and roaring stream\\nof humanity, with tossing arms and fiery faces, groping and\\nglaring towards them. The long dark line was dotted with torches\\nand lanterns; but even where no flame lit up a furious face, they\\ncould see in the farthest figure, in the most shadowy gesture, an\\norganised hate. It was clear that they were the accursed of all\\nmen, and they knew not why.\\n\\nTwo or three men, looking little and black like monkeys, leapt\\nover the edge as they had done and dropped on to the beach. These\\ncame ploughing down the deep sand, shouting horribly, and strove\\nto wade into the sea at random. The example was followed, and the\\nwhole black mass of men began to run and drip over the edge like\\nblack treacle.\\n\\nForemost among the men on the beach Syme saw the peasant who had\\ndriven their cart. He splashed into the surf on a huge\\ncart-horse, and shook his axe at them.\\n\\n\"The peasant!\" cried Syme. \"They have not risen since the Middle\\nAges.\"\\n\\n\"Even if the police do come now,\" said the Professor mournfully,\\n\"they can do nothing with this mob.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsence!\" said Bull desperately; \"there must be some people\\nleft in the town who are human.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said the hopeless Inspector, \"the human being will soon be\\nextinct. We are the last of mankind.\"\\n\\n\"It may be,\" said the Professor absently. Then he added in his\\ndreamy voice, \"What is all that at the end of the \\'Dunciad\\'?\\n\\n\\'Nor public flame; nor private, dares to shine;\\nNor human light is left, nor glimpse divine!\\nLo! thy dread Empire, Chaos, is restored;\\nLight dies before thine uncreating word:\\nThy hand, great Anarch, lets the curtain fall;\\nAnd universal darkness buries all.\"\\'\\n\\n\"Stop!\" cried Bull suddenly, \"the gendarmes are out.\"\\n\\nThe low lights of the police station were indeed blotted and\\nbroken with hurrying figures, and they heard through the darkness\\nthe clash and jingle of a disciplined cavalry.\\n\\n\"They are charging the mob!\" cried Bull in ecstacy or alarm.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Syme, \"they are formed along the parade.\"\\n\\n\"They have unslung their carbines,\" cried Bull dancing with\\nexcitement.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Ratcliffe, \"and they are going to fire on us.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke there came a long crackle of musketry, and bullets\\nseemed to hop like hailstones on the stones in front of them.\\n\\n\"The gendarmes have joined them!\" cried the Professor, and struck\\nhis forehead.\\n\\n\"I am in the padded cell,\" said Bull solidly.\\n\\nThere was a long silence, and then Ratcliffe said, looking out\\nover the swollen sea, all a sort of grey purple--\\n\\n\"What does it matter who is mad or who is sane? We shall all be\\ndead soon.\"\\n\\nSyme turned to him and said--\\n\\n\"You are quite hopeless, then?\"\\n\\nMr. Ratcliffe kept a stony silence; then at last he said quietly--\\n\\n\"No; oddly enough I am not quite hopeless. There is one insane\\nlittle hope that I cannot get out of my mind. The power of this\\nwhole planet is against us, yet I cannot help wondering whether\\nthis one silly little hope is hopeless yet.\"\\n\\n\"In what or whom is your hope?\" asked Syme with curiosity.\\n\\n\"In a man I never saw,\" said the other, looking at the leaden sea.\\n\\n\"I know what you mean,\" said Syme in a low voice, \"the man in the\\ndark room. But Sunday must have killed him by now.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said the other steadily; \"but if so, he was the only\\nman whom Sunday found it hard to kill.\"\\n\\n\"I heard what you said,\" said the Professor, with his back turned.\\n\"I also am holding hard on to the thing I never saw.\"\\n\\nAll of a sudden Syme, who was standing as if blind with\\nintrospective thought, swung round and cried out, like a man\\nwaking from sleep--\\n\\n\"Where is the Colonel? I thought he was with us!\"\\n\\n\"The Colonel! Yes,\" cried Bull, \"where on earth is the Colonel?\"\\n\\n\"He went to speak to Renard,\" said the Professor.\\n\\n\"We cannot leave him among all those beasts,\" cried Syme. \"Let us\\ndie like gentlemen if--\"\\n\\n\"Do not pity the Colonel,\" said Ratcliffe, with a pale sneer. \"He\\nis extremely comfortable. He is--\"\\n\\n\"No! no! no!\" cried Syme in a kind of frenzy, \"not the Colonel too!\\nI will never believe it!\"\\n\\n\"Will you believe your eyes?\" asked the other, and pointed to the\\nbeach.\\n\\nMany of their pursuers had waded into the water shaking their\\nfists, but the sea was rough, and they could not reach the pier.\\nTwo or three figures, however, stood on the beginning of the stone\\nfootway, and seemed to be cautiously advancing down it. The glare\\nof a chance lantern lit up the faces of the two foremost. One face\\nwore a black half-mask, and under it the mouth was twisting about\\nin such a madness of nerves that the black tuft of beard wriggled\\nround and round like a restless, living thing. The other was the\\nred face and white moustache of Colonel Ducroix. They were in\\nearnest consultation.\\n\\n\"Yes, he is gone too,\" said the Professor, and sat down on a\\nstone. \"Everything\\'s gone. I\\'m gone! I can\\'t trust my own bodily\\nmachinery. I feel as if my own hand might fly up and strike me.\"\\n\\n\"When my hand flies up,\" said Syme, \"it will strike somebody\\nelse,\" and he strode along the pier towards the Colonel, the\\nsword in one hand and the lantern in the other.\\n\\nAs if to destroy the last hope or doubt, the Colonel, who saw him\\ncoming, pointed his revolver at him and fired. The shot missed\\nSyme, but struck his sword, breaking it short at the hilt. Syme\\nrushed on, and swung the iron lantern above his head.\\n\\n\"Judas before Herod!\" he said, and struck the Colonel down upon\\nthe stones. Then he turned to the Secretary, whose frightful mouth\\nwas almost foaming now, and held the lamp high with so rigid and\\narresting a gesture, that the man was, as it were, frozen for a\\nmoment, and forced to hear.\\n\\n\"Do you see this lantern?\" cried Syme in a terrible voice. \"Do you\\nsee the cross carved on it, and the flame inside? You did not make\\nit. You did not light it, Better men than you, men who could\\nbelieve and obey, twisted the entrails of iron and preserved the\\nlegend of fire. There is not a street you walk on, there is not a\\nthread you wear, that was not made as this lantern was, by denying\\nyour philosophy of dirt and rats. You can make nothing. You can\\nonly destroy. You will destroy mankind; you will destroy the world.\\nLet that suffice you. Yet this one old Christian lantern you shall\\nnot destroy. It shall go where your empire of apes will never have\\nthe wit to find it.\"\\n\\nHe struck the Secretary once with the lantern so that he staggered;\\nand then, whirling it twice round his head, sent it flying far out\\nto sea, where it flared like a roaring rocket and fell.\\n\\n\"Swords!\" shouted Syme, turning his flaming face ; to the three\\nbehind him. \"Let us charge these dogs, for our time has come to\\ndie.\"\\n\\nHis three companions came after him sword in hand. Syme\\'s sword\\nwas broken, but he rent a bludgeon from the fist of a fisherman,\\nflinging him down. In a moment they would have flung themselves\\nupon the face of the mob and perished, when an interruption came.\\nThe Secretary, ever since Syme\\'s speech, had stood with his hand\\nto his stricken head as if dazed; now he suddenly pulled off his\\nblack mask.\\n\\nThe pale face thus peeled in the lamplight revealed not so much\\nrage as astonishment. He put up his hand with an anxious authority.\\n\\n\"There is some mistake,\" he said. \"Mr. Syme, I hardly think you\\nunderstand your position. I arrest you in the name of the law.\"\\n\\n\"Of the law?\" said Syme, and dropped his stick.\\n\\n\"Certainly!\" said the Secretary. \"I am a detective from Scotland\\nYard,\" and he took a small blue card from his pocket.\\n\\n\"And what do you suppose we are?\" asked the Professor, and threw\\nup his arms.\\n\\n\"You,\" said the Secretary stiffly, \"are, as I know for a fact,\\nmembers of the Supreme Anarchist Council. Disguised as one of\\nyou, I--\"\\n\\nDr. Bull tossed his sword into the sea.\\n\\n\"There never was any Supreme Anarchist Council,\" he said. \"We were\\nall a lot of silly policemen looking at each other. And all these\\nnice people who have been peppering us with shot thought we were\\nthe dynamiters. I knew I couldn\\'t be wrong about the mob,\" he said,\\nbeaming over the enormous multitude, which stretched away to the\\ndistance on both sides. \"Vulgar people are never mad. I\\'m vulgar\\nmyself, and I know. I am now going on shore to stand a drink to\\neverybody here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nTHE PURSUIT OF THE PRESIDENT\\n\\nNEXT morning five bewildered but hilarious people took the boat for\\nDover. The poor old Colonel might have had some cause to complain,\\nhaving been first forced to fight for two factions that didn\\'t\\nexist, and then knocked down with an iron lantern. But he was a\\nmagnanimous old gentleman, and being much relieved that neither\\nparty had anything to do with dynamite, he saw them off on the pier\\nwith great geniality.\\n\\nThe five reconciled detectives had a hundred details to explain to\\neach other. The Secretary had to tell Syme how they had come to\\nwear masks originally in order to approach the supposed enemy as\\nfellow-conspirators;\\n\\nSyme had to explain how they had fled with such swiftness through\\na civilised country. But above all these matters of detail which\\ncould be explained, rose the central mountain of the matter that\\nthey could not explain. What did it all mean? If they were all\\nharmless officers, what was Sunday? If he had not seized the world,\\nwhat on earth had he been up to? Inspector Ratcliffe was still\\ngloomy about this.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t make head or tail of old Sunday\\'s little game any more\\nthan you can,\" he said. \"But whatever else Sunday is, he isn\\'t\\na blameless citizen. Damn it! do you remember his face?\"\\n\\n\"I grant you,\" answered Syme, \"that I have never been able to\\nforget it.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the Secretary, \"I suppose we can find out soon, for\\ntomorrow we have our next general meeting. You will excuse me,\"\\nhe said, with a rather ghastly smile, \"for being well acquainted\\nwith my secretarial duties.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose you are right,\" said the Professor reflectively. \"I\\nsuppose we might find it out from him; but I confess that I should\\nfeel a bit afraid of asking Sunday who he really is.\"\\n\\n\"Why,\" asked the Secretary, \"for fear of bombs?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said the Professor, \"for fear he might tell me.\"\\n\\n\"Let us have some drinks,\" said Dr. Bull, after a silence.\\n\\nThroughout their whole journey by boat and train they were highly\\nconvivial, but they instinctively kept together. Dr. Bull, who had\\nalways been the optimist of the party, endeavoured to persuade the\\nother four that the whole company could take the same hansom cab\\nfrom Victoria; but this was over-ruled, and they went in a\\nfour-wheeler, with Dr. Bull on the box, singing. They finished\\ntheir journey at an hotel in Piccadilly Circus, so as to be close\\nto the early breakfast next morning in Leicester Square. Yet even\\nthen the adventures of the day were not entirely over. Dr. Bull,\\ndiscontented with the general proposal to go to bed, had strolled\\nout of the hotel at about eleven to see and taste some of the\\nbeauties of London. Twenty minutes afterwards, however, he came\\nback and made quite a clamour in the hall. Syme, who tried at\\nfirst to soothe him, was forced at last to listen to his\\ncommunication with quite new attention.\\n\\n\"I tell you I\\'ve seen him!\" said Dr. Bull, with thick emphasis.\\n\\n\"Whom?\" asked Syme quickly. \"Not the President?\"\\n\\n\"Not so bad as that,\" said Dr. Bull, with unnecessary laughter,\\n\"not so bad as that. I\\'ve got him here.\"\\n\\n\"Got whom here?\" asked Syme impatiently.\\n\\n\"Hairy man,\" said the other lucidly, \"man that used to be hairy\\nman--Gogol. Here he is,\" and he pulled forward by a reluctant\\nelbow the identical young man who five days before had marched\\nout of the Council with thin red hair and a pale face, the first\\nof all the sham anarchists who had been exposed.\\n\\n\"Why do you worry with me?\" he cried. \"You have expelled me as a\\nspy.\"\\n\\n\"We are all spies!\" whispered Syme.\\n\\n\"We\\'re all spies!\" shouted Dr. Bull. \"Come and have a drink.\"\\n\\nNext morning the battalion of the reunited six marched stolidly\\ntowards the hotel in Leicester Square.\\n\\n\"This is more cheerful,\" said Dr. Bull; \"we are six men going to\\nask one man what he means.\"\\n\\n\"I think it is a bit queerer than that,\" said Syme. \"I think it\\nis six men going to ask one man what they mean.\"\\n\\nThey turned in silence into the Square, and though the hotel was\\nin the opposite corner, they saw at once the little balcony and a\\nfigure that looked too big for it. He was sitting alone with bent\\nhead, poring over a newspaper. But all his councillors, who had\\ncome to vote him down, crossed that Square as if they were watched\\nout of heaven by a hundred eyes.\\n\\nThey had disputed much upon their policy, about whether they\\nshould leave the unmasked Gogol without and begin diplomatically,\\nor whether they should bring him in and blow up the gunpowder at\\nonce. The influence of Syme and Bull prevailed for the latter\\ncourse, though the Secretary to the last asked them why they\\nattacked Sunday so rashly.\\n\\n\"My reason is quite simple,\" said Syme. \"I attack him rashly\\nbecause I am afraid of him.\"\\n\\nThey followed Syme up the dark stair in silence, and they all came\\nout simultaneously into the broad sunlight of the morning and the\\nbroad sunlight of Sunday\\'s smile.\\n\\n\"Delightful!\" he said. \"So pleased to see you all. What an\\nexquisite day it is. Is the Czar dead?\"\\n\\nThe Secretary, who happened to be foremost, drew himself together\\nfor a dignified outburst.\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" he said sternly \"there has been no massacre. I bring you\\nnews of no such disgusting spectacles.\"\\n\\n\"Disgusting spectacles?\" repeated the President, with a bright,\\ninquiring smile. \"You mean Dr. Bull\\'s spectacles?\"\\n\\nThe Secretary choked for a moment, and the President went on with\\na sort of smooth appeal--\\n\\n\"Of course, we all have our opinions and even our eyes, but really\\nto call them disgusting before the man himself--\"\\n\\nDr. Bull tore off his spectacles and broke them on the table.\\n\\n\"My spectacles are blackguardly,\" he said, \"but I\\'m not. Look at\\nmy face.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say it\\'s the sort of face that grows on one,\" said the\\nPresident, \"in fact, it grows on you; and who am I to quarrel\\nwith the wild fruits upon the Tree of Life? I dare say it will\\ngrow on me some day.\"\\n\\n\"We have no time for tomfoolery,\" said the Secretary, breaking in\\nsavagely. \"We have come to know what all this means. Who are you?\\nWhat are you? Why did you get us all here? Do you know who and\\nwhat we are? Are you a half-witted man playing the conspirator,\\nor are you a clever man playing the fool? Answer me, I tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Candidates,\" murmured Sunday, \"are only required to answer eight\\nout of the seventeen questions on the paper. As far as I can make\\nout, you want me to tell you what I am, and what you are, and what\\nthis table is, and what this Council is, and what this world is\\nfor all I know. Well, I will go so far as to rend the veil of one\\nmystery. If you want to know what you are, you are a set of\\nhighly well-intentioned young jackasses.\"\\n\\n\"And you,\" said Syme, leaning forward, \"what are you?\"\\n\\n\"I? What am I?\" roared the President, and he rose slowly to an\\nincredible height, like some enormous wave about to arch above\\nthem and break. \"You want to know what I am, do you? Bull, you\\nare a man of science. Grub in the roots of those trees and find\\nout the truth about them. Syme, you are a poet. Stare at those\\nmorning clouds. But I tell you this, that you will have found\\nout the truth of the last tree and the top-most cloud before the\\ntruth about me. You will understand the sea, and I shall be still\\na riddle; you shall know what the stars are, and not know what I\\nam. Since the beginning of the world all men have hunted me like\\na wolf--kings and sages, and poets and lawgivers, all the\\nchurches, and all the philosophies. But I have never been caught\\nyet, and the skies will fall in the time I turn to bay. I have\\ngiven them a good run for their money, and I will now.\"\\n\\nBefore one of them could move, the monstrous man had swung himself\\nlike some huge ourang-outang over the balustrade of the balcony.\\nYet before he dropped he pulled himself up again as on a horizontal\\nbar, and thrusting his great chin over the edge of the balcony,\\nsaid solemnly--\\n\\n\"There\\'s one thing I\\'ll tell you though about who I am. I am the\\nman in the dark room, who made you all policemen.\"\\n\\nWith that he fell from the balcony, bouncing on the stones below\\nlike a great ball of india-rubber, and went bounding off towards\\nthe corner of the Alhambra, where he hailed a hansom-cab and sprang\\ninside it. The six detectives had been standing thunderstruck and\\nlivid in the light of his last assertion; but when he disappeared\\ninto the cab, Syme\\'s practical senses returned to him, and leaping\\nover the balcony so recklessly as almost to break his legs, he\\ncalled another cab.\\n\\nHe and Bull sprang into the cab together, the Professor and the\\nInspector into another, while the Secretary and the late Gogol\\nscrambled into a third just in time to pursue the flying Syme, who\\nwas pursuing the flying President. Sunday led them a wild chase\\ntowards the north-west, his cabman, evidently under the influence\\nof more than common inducements, urging the horse at breakneck\\nspeed. But Syme was in no mood for delicacies, and he stood up in\\nhis own cab shouting, \"Stop thief!\" until crowds ran along beside\\nhis cab, and policemen began to stop and ask questions. All this\\nhad its influence upon the President\\'s cabman, who began to look\\ndubious, and to slow down to a trot. He opened the trap to talk\\nreasonably to his fare, and in so doing let the long whip droop\\nover the front of the cab. Sunday leant forward, seized it, and\\njerked it violently out of the man\\'s hand. Then standing up in\\nfront of the cab himself, he lashed the horse and roared aloud,\\nso that they went down the streets like a flying storm. Through\\nstreet after street and square after square went whirling this\\npreposterous vehicle, in which the fare was urging the horse and\\nthe driver trying desperately to stop it. The other three cabs\\ncame after it (if the phrase be permissible of a cab) like panting\\nhounds. Shops and streets shot by like rattling arrows.\\n\\nAt the highest ecstacy of speed, Sunday turned round on the\\nsplashboard where he stood, and sticking his great grinning head\\nout of the cab, with white hair whistling in the wind, he made a\\nhorrible face at his pursuers, like some colossal urchin. Then\\nraising his right hand swiftly, he flung a ball of paper in Syme\\'s\\nface and vanished. Syme caught the thing while instinctively\\nwarding it off, and discovered that it consisted of two crumpled\\npapers. One was addressed to himself, and the other to Dr. Bull,\\nwith a very long, and it is to be feared partly ironical, string\\nof letters after his name. Dr. Bull\\'s address was, at any rate,\\nconsiderably longer than his communication, for the communication\\nconsisted entirely of the words:--\\n\\n\"What about Martin Tupper now?\"\\n\\n\"What does the old maniac mean?\" asked Bull, staring at the words.\\n\"What does yours say, Syme?\"\\n\\nSyme\\'s message was, at any rate, longer, and ran as follows:--\\n\\n\"No one would regret anything in the nature of an interference by\\nthe Archdeacon more than I. I trust it will not come to that. But,\\nfor the last time, where are your goloshes? The thing is too bad,\\nespecially after what uncle said.\"\\n\\nThe President\\'s cabman seemed to be regaining some control over\\nhis horse, and the pursuers gained a little as they swept round\\ninto the Edgware Road. And here there occurred what seemed to the\\nallies a providential stoppage. Traffic of every kind was swerving\\nto right or left or stopping, for down the long road was coming\\nthe unmistakable roar announcing the fire-engine, which in a few\\nseconds went by like a brazen thunderbolt. But quick as it went\\nby, Sunday had bounded out of his cab, sprung at the fire-engine,\\ncaught it, slung himself on to it, and was seen as he disappeared\\nin the noisy distance talking to the astonished fireman with\\nexplanatory gestures.\\n\\n\"After him!\" howled Syme. \"He can\\'t go astray now. There\\'s no\\nmistaking a fire-engine.\"\\n\\nThe three cabmen, who had been stunned for a moment, whipped\\nup their horses and slightly decreased the distance between\\nthemselves and their disappearing prey. The President\\nacknowledged this proximity by coming to the back of the car,\\nbowing repeatedly, kissing his hand, and finally flinging a\\nneatly-folded note into the bosom of Inspector Ratcliffe. When\\nthat gentleman opened it, not without impatience, he found it\\ncontained the words:--\\n\\n\"Fly at once. The truth about your trouser-stretchers is known.\\n--A FRIEND.\"\\n\\nThe fire-engine had struck still farther to the north, into a\\nregion that they did not recognise; and as it ran by a line of high\\nrailings shadowed with trees, the six friends were startled, but\\nsomewhat relieved, to see the President leap from the fire-engine,\\nthough whether through another whim or the increasing protest of\\nhis entertainers they could not see. Before the three cabs,\\nhowever, could reach up to the spot, he had gone up the high\\nrailings like a huge grey cat, tossed himself over, and vanished\\nin a darkness of leaves.\\n\\nSyme with a furious gesture stopped his cab, jumped out, and\\nsprang also to the escalade. When he had one leg over the fence\\nand his friends were following, he turned a face on them which\\nshone quite pale in the shadow.\\n\\n\"What place can this be?\" he asked. \"Can it be the old devil\\'s\\nhouse? I\\'ve heard he has a house in North London.\"\\n\\n\"All the better,\" said the Secretary grimly, planting a foot in\\na foothold, \"we shall find him at home.\"\\n\\n\"No, but it isn\\'t that,\" said Syme, knitting his brows. \"I hear\\nthe most horrible noises, like devils laughing and sneezing and\\nblowing their devilish noses!\"\\n\\n\"His dogs barking, of course,\" said the Secretary.\\n\\n\"Why not say his black-beetles barking!\" said Syme furiously,\\n\"snails barking! geraniums barking! Did you ever hear a dog bark\\nlike that?\"\\n\\nHe held up his hand, and there came out of the thicket a long\\ngrowling roar that seemed to get under the skin and freeze the\\nflesh--a low thrilling roar that made a throbbing in the air\\nall about them.\\n\\n\"The dogs of Sunday would be no ordinary dogs,\" said Gogol, and\\nshuddered.\\n\\nSyme had jumped down on the other side, but he still stood\\nlistening impatiently.\\n\\n\"Well, listen to that,\" he said, \"is that a dog--anybody\\'s dog?\"\\n\\nThere broke upon their ear a hoarse screaming as of things\\nprotesting and clamouring in sudden pain; and then, far off\\nlike an echo, what sounded like a long nasal trumpet.\\n\\n\"Well, his house ought to be hell!\" said the Secretary; \"and if\\nit is hell, I\\'m going in!\" and he sprang over the tall railings\\nalmost with one swing.\\n\\nThe others followed. They broke through a tangle of plants and\\nshrubs, and came out on an open path. Nothing was in sight, but\\nDr. Bull suddenly struck his hands together.\\n\\n\"Why, you asses,\" he cried, \"it\\'s the Zoo!\"\\n\\nAs they were looking round wildly for any trace of their wild\\nquarry, a keeper in uniform came running along the path with a\\nman in plain clothes.\\n\\n\"Has it come this way?\" gasped the keeper.\\n\\n\"Has what?\" asked Syme.\\n\\n\"The elephant!\" cried the keeper. \"An elephant has gone mad and\\nrun away!\"\\n\\n\"He has run away with an old gentleman,\" said the other stranger\\nbreathlessly, \"a poor old gentleman with white hair! \"\\n\\n\"What sort of old gentleman?\" asked Syme, with great curiosity.\\n\\n\"A very large and fat old gentleman in light grey clothes,\" said\\nthe keeper eagerly.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Syme, \"if he\\'s that particular kind of old gentleman,\\nif you\\'re quite sure that he\\'s a large and fat old gentleman in\\ngrey clothes, you may take my word for it that the elephant has\\nnot run away with him. He has run away with the elephant. The\\nelephant is not made by God that could run away with him if he\\ndid not consent to the elopement. And, by thunder, there he is!\"\\n\\nThere was no doubt about it this time. Clean across the space of\\ngrass, about two hundred yards away, with a crowd screaming and\\nscampering vainly at his heels, went a huge grey elephant at an\\nawful stride, with his trunk thrown out as rigid as a ship\\'s\\nbowsprit, and trumpeting like the trumpet of doom. On the back of\\nthe bellowing and plunging animal sat President Sunday with all\\nthe placidity of a sultan, but goading the animal to a furious\\nspeed with some sharp object in his hand.\\n\\n\"Stop him!\" screamed the populace. \"He\\'ll be out of the gate!\"\\n\\n\"Stop a landslide!\" said the keeper. \"He is out of the gate!\"\\n\\nAnd even as he spoke, a final crash and roar of terror announced\\nthat the great grey elephant had broken out of the gates of the\\nZoological Gardens, and was careening down Albany Street like a\\nnew and swift sort of omnibus.\\n\\n\"Great Lord!\" cried Bull, \"I never knew an elephant could go so\\nfast. Well, it must be hansom-cabs again if we are to keep him in\\nsight.\"\\n\\nAs they raced along to the gate out of which the elephant had\\nvanished, Syme felt a glaring panorama of the strange animals in\\nthe cages which they passed. Afterwards he thought it queer that\\nhe should have seen them so clearly. He remembered especially\\nseeing pelicans, with their preposterous, pendant throats. He\\nwondered why the pelican was the symbol of charity, except it was\\nthat it wanted a good deal of charity to admire a pelican. He\\nremembered a hornbill, which was simply a huge yellow beak with a\\nsmall bird tied on behind it. The whole gave him a sensation, the\\nvividness of which he could not explain, that Nature was always\\nmaking quite mysterious jokes. Sunday had told them that they\\nwould understand him when they had understood the stars. He\\nwondered whether even the archangels understood the hornbill.\\n\\nThe six unhappy detectives flung themselves into cabs and followed\\nthe elephant sharing the terror which he spread through the long\\nstretch of the streets. This time Sunday did not turn round, but\\noffered them the solid stretch of his unconscious back, which\\nmaddened them, if possible, more than his previous mockeries. Just\\nbefore they came to Baker Street, however, he was seen to throw\\nsomething far up into the air, as a boy does a ball meaning to\\ncatch it again. But at their rate of racing it fell far behind,\\njust by the cab containing Gogol; and in faint hope of a clue or\\nfor some impulse unexplainable, he stopped his cab so as to pick it\\nup. It was addressed to himself, and was quite a bulky parcel. On\\nexamination, however, its bulk was found to consist of thirty-three\\npieces of paper of no value wrapped one round the other. When the\\nlast covering was torn away it reduced itself to a small slip of\\npaper, on which was written:--\\n\\n\"The word, I fancy, should be \\'pink\\'.\"\\n\\nThe man once known as Gogol said nothing, but the movements of his\\nhands and feet were like those of a man urging a horse to renewed\\nefforts.\\n\\nThrough street after street, through district after district, went\\nthe prodigy of the flying elephant, calling crowds to every window,\\nand driving the traffic left and right. And still through all this\\ninsane publicity the three cabs toiled after it, until they came to\\nbe regarded as part of a procession, and perhaps the advertisement\\nof a circus. They went at such a rate that distances were shortened\\nbeyond belief, and Syme saw the Albert Hall in Kensington when he\\nthought that he was still in Paddington. The animal\\'s pace was even\\nmore fast and free through the empty, aristocratic streets of South\\nKensington, and he finally headed towards that part of the sky-line\\nwhere the enormous Wheel of Earl\\'s Court stood up in the sky. The\\nwheel grew larger and larger, till it filled heaven like the wheel\\nof stars.\\n\\nThe beast outstripped the cabs. They lost him round several\\ncorners, and when they came to one of the gates of the Earl\\'s Court\\nExhibition they found themselves finally blocked. In front of them\\nwas an enormous crowd; in the midst of it was an enormous elephant,\\nheaving and shuddering as such shapeless creatures do. But the\\nPresident had disappeared.\\n\\n\"Where has he gone to?\" asked Syme, slipping to the ground.\\n\\n\"Gentleman rushed into the Exhibition, sir!\" said an official in a\\ndazed manner. Then he added in an injured voice: \"Funny gentleman,\\nsir. Asked me to hold his horse, and gave me this.\"\\n\\nHe held out with distaste a piece of folded paper, addressed: \"To\\nthe Secretary of the Central Anarchist Council.\"\\n\\nThe Secretary, raging, rent it open, and found written inside it:--\\n\\n\"When the herring runs a mile,\\nLet the Secretary smile;\\nWhen the herring tries to fly,\\nLet the Secretary die.\\n                Rustic Proverb.\"\\n\\n\"Why the eternal crikey,\" began the Secretary, \"did you let the\\nman in? Do people commonly come to you Exhibition riding on mad\\nelephants? Do--\"\\n\\n\"Look!\" shouted Syme suddenly. \"Look over there!\"\\n\\n\"Look at what?\" asked the Secretary savagely.\\n\\n\"Look at the captive balloon!\" said Syme, and pointed in a frenzy.\\n\\n\"Why the blazes should I look at a captive balloon?\\' demanded the\\nSecretary. \"What is there queer about a captive balloon?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" said Syme, \"except that it isn\\'t captive!\\'\\n\\nThey all turned their eyes to where the balloon swung and swelled\\nabove the Exhibition on a string, like a child\\'s balloon. A second\\nafterwards the string came in two just under the car, and the\\nballoon, broken loose, floated away with the freedom of a soap\\nbubble.\\n\\n\"Ten thousand devils!\" shrieked the Secretary. \"He\\'s got into it!\"\\nand he shook his fists at the sky.\\n\\nThe balloon, borne by some chance wind, came right above them, and\\nthey could see the great white head of the President peering over\\nthe side and looking benevolently down on them.\\n\\n\"God bless my soul!\" said the Professor with the elderly manner\\nthat he could never disconnect from his bleached beard and\\nparchment face. \"God bless my soul! I seemed to fancy that\\nsomething fell on the top of my hat!\"\\n\\nHe put up a trembling hand and took from that shelf a piece of\\ntwisted paper, which he opened absently only to find it inscribed\\nwith a true lover\\'s knot and, the words:--\\n\\n\"Your beauty has not left me indifferent.--From LITTLE SNOWDROP. \"\\n\\nThere was a short silence, and then Syme said, biting his beard--\\n\\n\"I\\'m not beaten yet. The blasted thing must come down somewhere.\\nLet\\'s follow it!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\nTHE SIX PHILOSOPHERS\\n\\nACROSS green fields, and breaking through blooming hedges, toiled\\nsix draggled detectives, about five miles out of London. The\\noptimist of the party had at first proposed that they should\\nfollow the balloon across South England in hansom-cabs. But he\\nwas ultimately convinced of the persistent refusal of the balloon\\nto follow the roads, and the still more persistent refusal of the\\ncabmen to follow the balloon. Consequently the tireless though\\nexasperated travellers broke through black thickets and ploughed\\nthrough ploughed fields till each was turned into a figure too\\noutrageous to be mistaken for a tramp. Those green hills of\\nSurrey saw the final collapse and tragedy of the admirable light\\ngrey suit in which Syme had set out from Saffron Park. His silk\\nhat was broken over his nose by a swinging bough, his coat-tails\\nwere torn to the shoulder by arresting thorns, the clay of\\nEngland was splashed up to his collar; but he still carried his\\nyellow beard forward with a silent and furious determination, and\\nhis eyes were still fixed on that floating ball of gas, which in\\nthe full flush of sunset seemed coloured like a sunset cloud.\\n\\n\"After all,\" he said, \"it is very beautiful!\"\\n\\n\"It is singularly and strangely beautiful!\" said the Professor. \"I\\nwish the beastly gas-bag would burst!\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Dr. Bull, \"I hope it won\\'t. It might hurt the old boy.\"\\n\\n\"Hurt him!\" said the vindictive Professor, \"hurt him! Not as much\\nas I\\'d hurt him if I could get up with him. Little Snowdrop!\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want him hurt, somehow,\" said Dr. Bull.\\n\\n\"What!\" cried the Secretary bitterly. \"Do you believe all that tale\\nabout his being our man in the dark room? Sunday would say he was\\nanybody.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know whether I believe it or not,\" said Dr. Bull. \"But it\\nisn\\'t that that I mean. I can\\'t wish old Sunday\\'s balloon to burst\\nbecause--\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Syme impatiently, \"because?\"\\n\\n\"Well, because he\\'s so jolly like a balloon himself,\" said Dr. Bull\\ndesperately. \"I don\\'t understand a word of all that idea of his\\nbeing the same man who gave us all our blue cards. It seems to make\\neverything nonsense. But I don\\'t care who knows it, I always had a\\nsympathy for old Sunday himself, wicked as he was. Just as if he\\nwas a great bouncing baby. How can I explain what my queer sympathy\\nwas? It didn\\'t prevent my fighting him like hell! Shall I make it\\nclear if I say that I liked him because he was so fat?\"\\n\\n\"You will not,\" said the Secretary.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got it now,\" cried Bull, \"it was because he was so fat and so\\nlight. Just like a balloon. We always think of fat people as heavy,\\nbut he could have danced against a sylph. I see now what I mean.\\nModerate strength is shown in violence, supreme strength is shown\\nin levity. It was like the old speculations--what would happen if\\nan elephant could leap up in the sky like a grasshopper?\"\\n\\n\"Our elephant,\" said Syme, looking upwards, \"has leapt into the\\nsky like a grasshopper.\"\\n\\n\"And somehow,\" concluded Bull, \"that\\'s why I can\\'t help liking old\\nSunday. No, it\\'s not an admiration of force, or any silly thing\\nlike that. There is a kind of gaiety in the thing, as if he were\\nbursting with some good news. Haven\\'t you sometimes felt it on a\\nspring day? You know Nature plays tricks, but somehow that day\\nproves they are good-natured tricks. I never read the Bible myself,\\nbut that part they laugh at is literal truth, \\'Why leap ye, ye high\\nhills?\\' The hills do leap--at least, they try to. . . . Why do I\\nlike Sunday? . . . how can I tell you? . . . because he\\'s such a\\nBounder.\"\\n\\nThere was a long silence, and then the Secretary said in a curious,\\nstrained voice--\\n\\n\"You do not know Sunday at all. Perhaps it is because you are\\nbetter than I, and do not know hell. I was a fierce fellow, and a\\ntrifle morbid from the first. The man who sits in darkness, and\\nwho chose us all, chose me because I had all the crazy look of a\\nconspirator--because my smile went crooked, and my eyes were\\ngloomy, even when I smiled. But there must have been something in\\nme that answered to the nerves in all these anarchic men. For when\\nI first saw Sunday he expressed to me, not your airy vitality, but\\nsomething both gross and sad in the Nature of Things. I found him\\nsmoking in a twilight room, a room with brown blind down,\\ninfinitely more depressing than the genial darkness in which our\\nmaster lives. He sat there on a bench, a huge heap of a man, dark\\nand out of shape. He listened to all my words without speaking or\\neven stirring. I poured out my most passionate appeals, and asked\\nmy most eloquent questions. Then, after a long silence, the Thing\\nbegan to shake, and I thought it was shaken by some secret malady.\\nIt shook like a loathsome and living jelly. It reminded me of\\neverything I had ever read about the base bodies that are the\\norigin of life--the deep sea lumps and protoplasm. It seemed like\\nthe final form of matter, the most shapeless and the most shameful.\\nI could only tell myself, from its shudderings, that it was\\nsomething at least that such a monster could be miserable. And\\nthen it broke upon me that the bestial mountain was shaking with\\na lonely laughter, and the laughter was at me. Do you ask me to\\nforgive him that? It is no small thing to be laughed at by\\nsomething at once lower and stronger than oneself.\"\\n\\n\"Surely you fellows are exaggerating wildly,\" cut in the clear\\nvoice of Inspector Ratcliffe. \"President Sunday is a terrible\\nfellow for one\\'s intellect, but he is not such a Barnum\\'s freak\\nphysically as you make out. He received me in an ordinary office,\\nin a grey check coat, in broad daylight. He talked to me in an\\nordinary way. But I\\'ll tell you what is a trifle creepy about\\nSunday. His room is neat, his clothes are neat, everything seems\\nin order; but he\\'s absent-minded. Sometimes his great bright eyes\\ngo quite blind. For hours he forgets that you are there. Now\\nabsent-mindedness is just a bit too awful in a bad man. We think\\nof a wicked man as vigilant. We can\\'t think of a wicked man who is\\nhonestly and sincerely dreamy, because we daren\\'t think of a wicked\\nman alone with himself. An absentminded man means a good-natured\\nman. It means a man who, if he happens to see you, will apologise.\\nBut how will you bear an absentminded man who, if he happens to see\\nyou, will kill you? That is what tries the nerves, abstraction\\ncombined with cruelty. Men have felt it sometimes when they went\\nthrough wild forests, and felt that the animals there were at once\\ninnocent and pitiless. They might ignore or slay. How would you\\nlike to pass ten mortal hours in a parlour with an absent-minded\\ntiger?\"\\n\\n\"And what do you think of Sunday, Gogol?\" asked Syme.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think of Sunday on principle,\" said Gogol simply, \"any\\nmore than I stare at the sun at noonday.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that is a point of view,\" said Syme thoughtfully. \"What do\\nyou say, Professor?\"\\n\\nThe Professor was walking with bent head and trailing stick, and\\nhe did not answer at all.\\n\\n\"Wake up, Professor!\" said Syme genially. \"Tell us what you think\\nof Sunday.\"\\n\\nThe Professor spoke at last very slowly.\\n\\n\"I think something,\" he said, \"that I cannot say clearly. Or,\\nrather, I think something that I cannot even think clearly. But\\nit is something like this. My early life, as you know, was a bit\\ntoo large and loose.\\n\\nWell, when I saw Sunday\\'s face I thought it was too large--\\neverybody does, but I also thought it was too loose. The face\\nwas so big, that one couldn\\'t focus it or make it a face at all.\\nThe eye was so far away from the nose, that it wasn\\'t an eye.\\nThe mouth was so much by itself, that one had to think of it by\\nitself. The whole thing is too hard to explain.\"\\n\\nHe paused for a little, still trailing his stick, and then went\\non--\\n\\n\"But put it this way. Walking up a road at night, I have seen a\\nlamp and a lighted window and a cloud make together a most complete\\nand unmistakable face. If anyone in heaven has that face I shall\\nknow him again. Yet when I walked a little farther I found that\\nthere was no face, that the window was ten yards away, the lamp ten\\nhundred yards, the cloud beyond the world. Well, Sunday\\'s face\\nescaped me; it ran away to right and left, as such chance pictures\\nrun away. And so his face has made me, somehow, doubt whether there\\nare any faces. I don\\'t know whether your face, Bull, is a face or a\\ncombination in perspective. Perhaps one black disc of your beastly\\nglasses is quite close and another fifty miles away. Oh, the doubts\\nof a materialist are not worth a dump. Sunday has taught me the\\nlast and the worst doubts, the doubts of a spiritualist. I am a\\nBuddhist, I suppose; and Buddhism is not a creed, it is a doubt. My\\npoor dear Bull, I do not believe that you really have a face. I\\nhave not faith enough to believe in matter.\"\\n\\nSyme\\'s eyes were still fixed upon the errant orb, which, reddened\\nin the evening light, looked like some rosier and more innocent\\nworld.\\n\\n\"Have you noticed an odd thing,\" he said, \"about all your\\ndescriptions? Each man of you finds Sunday quite different, yet\\neach man of you can only find one thing to compare him to--the\\nuniverse itself. Bull finds him like the earth in spring, Gogol\\nlike the sun at noonday. The Secretary is reminded of the shapeless\\nprotoplasm, and the Inspector of the carelessness of virgin\\nforests. The Professor says he is like a changing landscape. This\\nis queer, but it is queerer still that I also have had my odd\\nnotion about the President, and I also find that I think of Sunday\\nas I think of the whole world.\"\\n\\n\"Get on a little faster, Syme,\" said Bull; \"never mind the\\nballoon.\"\\n\\n\"When I first saw Sunday,\" said Syme slowly, \"I only saw his back;\\nand when I saw his back, I knew he was the worst man in the world.\\nHis neck and shoulders were brutal, like those of some apish god.\\nHis head had a stoop that was hardly human, like the stoop of an\\nox. In fact, I had at once the revolting fancy that this was not\\na man at all, but a beast dressed up in men\\'s clothes.\"\\n\\n\"Get on,\" said Dr. Bull.\\n\\n\"And then the queer thing happened. I had seen his back from the\\nstreet, as he sat in the balcony. Then I entered the hotel, and\\ncoming round the other side of him, saw his face in the sunlight.\\nHis face frightened me, as it did everyone; but not because it was\\nbrutal, not because it was evil. On the contrary, it frightened me\\nbecause it was so beautiful, because it was so good.\"\\n\\n\"Syme,\" exclaimed the Secretary, \"are you ill?\"\\n\\n\"It was like the face of some ancient archangel, judging justly\\nafter heroic wars. There was laughter in the eyes, and in the mouth\\nhonour and sorrow. There was the same white hair, the same great,\\ngrey-clad shoulders that I had seen from behind. But when I saw him\\nfrom behind I was certain he was an animal, and when I saw him in\\nfront I knew he was a god.\"\\n\\n\"Pan,\" said the Professor dreamily, \"was a god and an animal.\"\\n\\n\"Then, and again and always,\" went on Syme like a man talking to\\nhimself, \"that has been for me the mystery of Sunday, and it is\\nalso the mystery of the world. When I see the horrible back, I am\\nsure the noble face is but a mask. When I see the face but for an\\ninstant, I know the back is only a jest. Bad is so bad, that we\\ncannot but think good an accident; good is so good, that we feel\\ncertain that evil could be explained. But the whole came to a kind\\nof crest yesterday when I raced Sunday for the cab, and was just\\nbehind him all the way.\"\\n\\n\"Had you time for thinking then?\" asked Ratcliffe.\\n\\n\"Time,\" replied Syme, \"for one outrageous thought. I was suddenly\\npossessed with the idea that the blind, blank back of his head\\nreally was his face--an awful, eyeless face staring at me! And I\\nfancied that the figure running in front of me was really a figure\\nrunning backwards, and dancing as he ran.\"\\n\\n\"Horrible!\" said Dr. Bull, and shuddered.\\n\\n\"Horrible is not the word,\" said Syme. \"It was exactly the worst\\ninstant of my life. And yet ten minutes afterwards, when he put his\\nhead out of the cab and made a grimace like a gargoyle, I knew that\\nhe was only like a father playing hide-and-seek with his children.\"\\n\\n\"It is a long game,\" said the Secretary, and frowned at his broken\\nboots.\\n\\n\"Listen to me,\" cried Syme with extraordinary emphasis. \"Shall I\\ntell you the secret of the whole world? It is that we have only\\nknown the back of the world. We see everything from behind, and it\\nlooks brutal. That is not a tree, but the back of a tree. That is\\nnot a cloud, but the back of a cloud. Cannot you see that\\neverything is stooping and hiding a face? If we could only get\\nround in front--\"\\n\\n\"Look!\" cried out Bull clamorously, \"the balloon is coming down!\"\\n\\nThere was no need to cry out to Syme, who had never taken his eyes\\noff it. He saw the great luminous globe suddenly stagger in the\\nsky, right itself, and then sink slowly behind the trees like a\\nsetting sun.\\n\\nThe man called Gogol, who had hardly spoken through all their weary\\ntravels, suddenly threw up his hands like a lost spirit.\\n\\n\"He is dead!\" he cried. \"And now I know he was my friend--my friend\\nin the dark!\"\\n\\n\"Dead!\" snorted the Secretary. \"You will not find him dead easily.\\nIf he has been tipped out of the car, we shall find him rolling as\\na colt rolls in a field, kicking his legs for fun.\"\\n\\n\"Clashing his hoofs,\" said the Professor. \"The colts do, and so did\\nPan.\"\\n\\n\"Pan again!\" said Dr. Bull irritably. \"You seem to think Pan is\\neverything.\"\\n\\n\"So he is,\" said the Professor, \"in Greek. He means everything.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t forget,\" said the Secretary, looking down, \"that he also\\nmeans Panic.\"\\n\\nSyme had stood without hearing any of the exclamations.\\n\\n\"It fell over there,\" he said shortly. \"Let us follow it!\"\\n\\nThen he added with an indescribable gesture--\\n\\n\"Oh, if he has cheated us all by getting killed! It would be like\\none of his larks.\"\\n\\nHe strode off towards the distant trees with a new energy, his rags\\nand ribbons fluttering in the wind. The others followed him in a\\nmore footsore and dubious manner. And almost at the same moment all\\nsix men realised that they were not alone in the little field.\\n\\nAcross the square of turf a tall man was advancing towards them,\\nleaning on a strange long staff like a sceptre. He was clad in a\\nfine but old-fashioned suit with knee-breeches; its colour was\\nthat shade between blue, violet and grey which can be seen in\\ncertain shadows of the woodland. His hair was whitish grey, and\\nat the first glance, taken along with his knee-breeches, looked\\nas if it was powdered. His advance was very quiet; but for the\\nsilver frost upon his head, he might have been one to the shadows\\nof the wood.\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"my master has a carriage waiting for you in\\nthe road just by.\"\\n\\n\"Who is your master?\" asked Syme, standing quite still.\\n\\n\"I was told you knew his name,\" said the man respectfully.\\n\\nThere was a silence, and then the Secretary said--\\n\\n\"Where is this carriage?\"\\n\\n\"It has been waiting only a few moments,\" said the stranger. \"My\\nmaster has only just come home.\"\\n\\nSyme looked left and right upon the patch of green field in which\\nhe found himself. The hedges were ordinary hedges, the trees seemed\\nordinary trees; yet he felt like a man entrapped in fairyland.\\n\\nHe looked the mysterious ambassador up and down, but he could\\ndiscover nothing except that the man\\'s coat was the exact colour of\\nthe purple shadows, and that the man\\'s face was the exact colour of\\nthe red and brown and golden sky.\\n\\n\"Show us the place,\" Syme said briefly, and without a word the man\\nin the violet coat turned his back and walked towards a gap in the\\nhedge, which let in suddenly the light of a white road.\\n\\nAs the six wanderers broke out upon this thoroughfare, they saw the\\nwhite road blocked by what looked like a long row of carriages,\\nsuch a row of carriages as might close the approach to some house\\nin Park Lane. Along the side of these carriages stood a rank of\\nsplendid servants, all dressed in the grey-blue uniform, and all\\nhaving a certain quality of stateliness and freedom which would not\\ncommonly belong to the servants of a gentleman, but rather to the\\nofficials and ambassadors of a great king. There were no less than\\nsix carriages waiting, one for each of the tattered and miserable\\nband. All the attendants (as if in court-dress) wore swords, and as\\neach man crawled into his carriage they drew them, and saluted with\\na sudden blaze of steel.\\n\\n\"What can it all mean?\" asked Bull of Syme as they separated. \"Is\\nthis another joke of Sunday\\'s?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Syme as he sank wearily back in the cushions\\nof his carriage; \"but if it is, it\\'s one of the jokes you talk\\nabout. It\\'s a good-natured one.\"\\n\\nThe six adventurers had passed through many adventures, but not one\\nhad carried them so utterly off their feet as this last adventure\\nof comfort. They had all become inured to things going roughly; but\\nthings suddenly going smoothly swamped them. They could not even\\nfeebly imagine what the carriages were; it was enough for them to\\nknow that they were carriages, and carriages with cushions. They\\ncould not conceive who the old man was who had led them; but it was\\nquite enough that he had certainly led them to the carriages.\\n\\nSyme drove through a drifting darkness of trees in utter\\nabandonment. It was typical of him that while he had carried his\\nbearded chin forward fiercely so long as anything could be done,\\nwhen the whole business was taken out of his hands he fell back\\non the cushions in a frank collapse.\\n\\nVery gradually and very vaguely he realised into what rich roads\\nthe carriage was carrying him. He saw that they passed the stone\\ngates of what might have been a park, that they began gradually to\\nclimb a hill which, while wooded on both sides, was somewhat more\\norderly than a forest. Then there began to grow upon him, as upon a\\nman slowly waking from a healthy sleep, a pleasure in everything.\\nHe felt that the hedges were what hedges should be, living walls;\\nthat a hedge is like a human army, disciplined, but all the more\\nalive. He saw high elms behind the hedges, and vaguely thought how\\nhappy boys would be climbing there. Then his carriage took a turn\\nof the path, and he saw suddenly and quietly, like a long, low,\\nsunset cloud, a long, low house, mellow in the mild light of\\nsunset. All the six friends compared notes afterwards and\\nquarrelled; but they all agreed that in some unaccountable way the\\nplace reminded them of their boyhood. It was either this elm-top\\nor that crooked path, it was either this scrap of orchard or that\\nshape of a window; but each man of them declared that he could\\nremember this place before he could remember his mother.\\n\\nWhen the carriages eventually rolled up to a large, low, cavernous\\ngateway, another man in the same uniform, but wearing a silver star\\non the grey breast of his coat, came out to meet them. This\\nimpressive person said to the bewildered Syme--\\n\\n\"Refreshments are provided for you in your room.\"\\n\\nSyme, under the influence of the same mesmeric sleep of amazement,\\nwent up the large oaken stairs after the respectful attendant. He\\nentered a splendid suite of apartments that seemed to be designed\\nspecially for him. He walked up to a long mirror with the ordinary\\ninstinct of his class, to pull his tie straight or to smooth his\\nhair; and there he saw the frightful figure that he was--blood\\nrunning down his face from where the bough had struck him, his hair\\nstanding out like yellow rags of rank grass, his clothes torn into\\nlong, wavering tatters. At once the whole enigma sprang up, simply\\nas the question of how he had got there, and how he was to get out\\nagain. Exactly at the same moment a man in blue, who had been\\nappointed as his valet, said very solemnly--\\n\\n\"I have put out your clothes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Clothes!\" said Syme sardonically. \"I have no clothes except\\nthese,\" and he lifted two long strips of his frock-coat in\\nfascinating festoons, and made a movement as if to twirl like\\na ballet girl.\\n\\n\"My master asks me to say,\" said the attendant, that there is a\\nfancy dress ball tonight, and that he desires you to put on the\\ncostume that I have laid out. Meanwhile, sir, there is a bottle\\nof Burgundy and some cold pheasant, which he hopes you will not\\nrefuse, as it is some hours before supper.\"\\n\\n\"Cold pheasant is a good thing,\" said Syme reflectively, \"and\\nBurgundy is a spanking good thing. But really I do not want either\\nof them so much as I want to know what the devil all this means,\\nand what sort of costume you have got laid out for me. Where is\\nit?\"\\n\\nThe servant lifted off a kind of ottoman a long peacock-blue\\ndrapery, rather of the nature of a domino, on the front of which\\nwas emblazoned a large golden sun, and which was splashed here\\nand there with flaming stars and crescents.\\n\\n\"You\\'re to be dressed as Thursday, sir,\" said the valet somewhat\\naffably.\\n\\n\"Dressed as Thursday!\" said Syme in meditation. \"It doesn\\'t sound\\na warm costume.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, sir,\" said the other eagerly, \"the Thursday costume is\\nquite warm, sir. It fastens up to the chin.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t understand anything,\" said Syme, sighing. \"I have\\nbeen used so long to uncomfortable adventures that comfortable\\nadventures knock me out. Still, I may be allowed to ask why I\\nshould be particularly like Thursday in a green frock spotted\\nall over with the sun and moon. Those orbs, I think, shine on\\nother days. I once saw the moon on Tuesday, I remember.\"\\n\\n\"Beg pardon, sir,\" said the valet, \"Bible also provided for you,\"\\nand with a respectful and rigid finger he pointed out a passage\\nin the first chapter of Genesis. Syme read it wondering. It was\\nthat in which the fourth day of the week is associated with the\\ncreation of the sun and moon. Here, however, they reckoned from\\na Christian Sunday.\\n\\n\"This is getting wilder and wilder,\" said Syme, as he sat down\\nin a chair. \"Who are these people who provide cold pheasant and\\nBurgundy, and green clothes and Bibles? Do they provide\\neverything?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, everything,\" said the attendant gravely. \"Shall I help\\nyou on with your costume?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, hitch the bally thing on!\" said Syme impatiently.\\n\\nBut though he affected to despise the mummery, he felt a curious\\nfreedom and naturalness in his movements as the blue and gold\\ngarment fell about him; and when he found that he had to wear a\\nsword, it stirred a boyish dream. As he passed out of the room he\\nflung the folds across his shoulder with a gesture, his sword\\nstood out at an angle, and he had all the swagger of a troubadour.\\nFor these disguises did not disguise, but reveal.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\nTHE ACCUSER\\n\\nAS Syme strode along the corridor he saw the Secretary standing at\\nthe top of a great flight of stairs. The man had never looked so\\nnoble. He was draped in a long robe of starless black, down the\\ncentre of which fell a band or broad stripe of pure white, like a\\nsingle shaft of light. The whole looked like some very severe\\necclesiastical vestment. There was no need for Syme to search his\\nmemory or the Bible in order to remember that the first day of\\ncreation marked the mere creation of light out of darkness. The\\nvestment itself would alone have suggested the symbol; and Syme\\nfelt also how perfectly this pattern of pure white and black\\nexpressed the soul of the pale and austere Secretary, with his\\ninhuman veracity and his cold frenzy, which made him so easily\\nmake war on the anarchists, and yet so easily pass for one of\\nthem. Syme was scarcely surprised to notice that, amid all the\\nease and hospitality of their new surroundings, this man\\'s eyes\\nwere still stern. No smell of ale or orchards could make the\\nSecretary cease to ask a reasonable question.\\n\\nIf Syme had been able to see himself, he would have realised that\\nhe, too, seemed to be for the first time himself and no one else.\\nFor if the Secretary stood for that philosopher who loves the\\noriginal and formless light, Syme was a type of the poet who seeks\\nalways to make the light in special shapes, to split it up into\\nsun and star. The philosopher may sometimes love the infinite; the\\npoet always loves the finite. For him the great moment is not the\\ncreation of light, but the creation of the sun and moon.\\n\\nAs they descended the broad stairs together they overtook\\nRatcliffe, who was clad in spring green like a huntsman, and the\\npattern upon whose garment was a green tangle of trees. For he\\nstood for that third day on which the earth and green things were\\nmade, and his square, sensible face, with its not unfriendly\\ncynicism, seemed appropriate enough to it.\\n\\nThey were led out of another broad and low gateway into a very\\nlarge old English garden, full of torches and bonfires, by the\\nbroken light of which a vast carnival of people were dancing in\\nmotley dress. Syme seemed to see every shape in Nature imitated\\nin some crazy costume. There was a man dressed as a windmill with\\nenormous sails, a man dressed as an elephant, a man dressed as a\\nballoon; the two last, together, seemed to keep the thread of\\ntheir farcical adventures. Syme even saw, with a queer thrill,\\none dancer dressed like an enormous hornbill, with a beak twice\\nas big as himself--the queer bird which had fixed itself on his\\nfancy like a living question while he was rushing down the long\\nroad at the Zoological Gardens. There were a thousand other such\\nobjects, however. There was a dancing lamp-post, a dancing apple\\ntree, a dancing ship. One would have thought that the untamable\\ntune of some mad musician had set all the common objects of field\\nand street dancing an eternal jig. And long afterwards, when Syme\\nwas middle-aged and at rest, he could never see one of those\\nparticular objects--a lamppost, or an apple tree, or a windmill--\\nwithout thinking that it was a strayed reveller from that revel\\nof masquerade.\\n\\nOn one side of this lawn, alive with dancers, was a sort of green\\nbank, like the terrace in such old-fashioned gardens.\\n\\nAlong this, in a kind of crescent, stood seven great chairs, the\\nthrones of the seven days. Gogol and Dr. Bull were already in their\\nseats; the Professor was just mounting to his. Gogol, or Tuesday,\\nhad his simplicity well symbolised by a dress designed upon the\\ndivision of the waters, a dress that separated upon his forehead\\nand fell to his feet, grey and silver, like a sheet of rain. The\\nProfessor, whose day was that on which the birds and fishes--the\\nruder forms of life--were created, had a dress of dim purple, over\\nwhich sprawled goggle-eyed fishes and outrageous tropical birds,\\nthe union in him of unfathomable fancy and of doubt. Dr. Bull, the\\nlast day of Creation, wore a coat covered with heraldic animals in\\nred and gold, and on his crest a man rampant. He lay back in his\\nchair with a broad smile, the picture of an optimist in his\\nelement.\\n\\nOne by one the wanderers ascended the bank and sat in their\\nstrange seats. As each of them sat down a roar of enthusiasm rose\\nfrom the carnival, such as that with which crowds receive kings.\\nCups were clashed and torches shaken, and feathered hats flung in\\nthe air. The men for whom these thrones were reserved were men\\ncrowned with some extraordinary laurels. But the central chair was\\nempty.\\n\\nSyme was on the left hand of it and the Secretary on the right.\\nThe Secretary looked across the empty throne at Syme, and said,\\ncompressing his lips--\\n\\n\"We do not know yet that he is not dead in a field.\"\\n\\nAlmost as Syme heard the words, he saw on the sea of human faces in\\nfront of him a frightful and beautiful alteration, as if heaven had\\nopened behind his head. But Sunday had only passed silently along\\nthe front like a shadow, and had sat in the central seat. He was\\ndraped plainly, in a pure and terrible white, and his hair was like\\na silver flame on his forehead.\\n\\nFor a long time--it seemed for hours--that huge masquerade of\\nmankind swayed and stamped in front of them to marching and\\nexultant music. Every couple dancing seemed a separate romance;\\nit might be a fairy dancing with a pillar-box, or a peasant girl\\ndancing with the moon; but in each case it was, somehow, as\\nabsurd as Alice in Wonderland, yet as grave and kind as a love\\nstory. At last, however, the thick crowd began to thin itself.\\nCouples strolled away into the garden-walks, or began to drift\\ntowards that end of the building where stood smoking, in huge\\npots like fish-kettles, some hot and scented mixtures of old ale\\nor wine. Above all these, upon a sort of black framework on the\\nroof of the house, roared in its iron basket a gigantic bonfire,\\nwhich lit up the land for miles. It flung the homely effect of\\nfirelight over the face of vast forests of grey or brown, and it\\nseemed to fill with warmth even the emptiness of upper night.\\nYet this also, after a time, was allowed to grow fainter; the\\ndim groups gathered more and more round the great cauldrons, or\\npassed, laughing and clattering, into the inner passages of that\\nancient house. Soon there were only some ten loiterers in the\\ngarden; soon only four. Finally the last stray merry-maker ran\\ninto the house whooping to his companions. The fire faded, and\\nthe slow, strong stars came out. And the seven strange men were\\nleft alone, like seven stone statues on their chairs of stone.\\nNot one of them had spoken a word.\\n\\nThey seemed in no haste to do so, but heard in silence the hum of\\ninsects and the distant song of one bird. Then Sunday spoke, but\\nso dreamily that he might have been continuing a conversation\\nrather than beginning one.\\n\\n\"We will eat and drink later,\" he said. \"Let us remain together a\\nlittle, we who have loved each other so sadly, and have fought so\\nlong. I seem to remember only centuries of heroic war, in which\\nyou were always heroes--epic on epic, iliad on iliad, and you\\nalways brothers in arms. Whether it was but recently (for time is\\nnothing), or at the beginning of the world, I sent you out to\\nwar. I sat in the darkness, where there is not any created thing,\\nand to you I was only a voice commanding valour and an unnatural\\nvirtue. You heard the voice in the dark, and you never heard it\\nagain. The sun in heaven denied it, the earth and sky denied it,\\nall human wisdom denied it. And when I met you in the daylight I\\ndenied it myself.\"\\n\\nSyme stirred sharply in his seat, but otherwise there was silence,\\nand the incomprehensible went on.\\n\\n\"But you were men. You did not forget your secret honour, though\\nthe whole cosmos turned an engine of torture to tear it out of\\nyou. I knew how near you were to hell. I know how you, Thursday,\\ncrossed swords with King Satan, and how you, Wednesday, named me\\nin the hour without hope.\"\\n\\nThere was complete silence in the starlit garden, and then the\\nblack-browed Secretary, implacable, turned in his chair towards\\nSunday, and said in a harsh voice--\\n\\n\"Who and what are you?\"\\n\\n\"I am the Sabbath,\" said the other without moving. \"I am the peace\\nof God.\"\\n\\nThe Secretary started up, and stood crushing his costly robe in his\\nhand.\\n\\n\"I know what you mean,\" he cried, \"and it is exactly that that I\\ncannot forgive you. I know you are contentment, optimism, what do\\nthey call the thing, an ultimate reconciliation. Well, I am not\\nreconciled. If you were the man in the dark room, why were you also\\nSunday, an offense to the sunlight? If you were from the first our\\nfather and our friend, why were you also our greatest enemy? We\\nwept, we fled in terror; the iron entered into our souls--and you\\nare the peace of God! Oh, I can forgive God His anger, though it\\ndestroyed nations; but I cannot forgive Him His peace.\"\\n\\nSunday answered not a word, but very slowly he turned his face of\\nstone upon Syme as if asking a question.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Syme, \"I do not feel fierce like that. I am grateful\\nto you, not only for wine and hospitality here, but for many a\\nfine scamper and free fight. But I should like to know. My soul\\nand heart are as happy and quiet here as this old garden, but my\\nreason is still crying out. I should like to know.\"\\n\\nSunday looked at Ratcliffe, whose clear voice said--\\n\\n\"It seems so silly that you should have been on both sides and\\nfought yourself.\"\\n\\nBull said--\\n\\n\"l understand nothing, but I am happy. In fact, I am going to\\nsleep.\"\\n\\n\"I am not happy,\" said the Professor with his head in his hands,\\n\"because I do not understand. You let me stray a little too near\\nto hell.\"\\n\\nAnd then Gogol said, with the absolute simplicity of a child--\\n\\n\"I wish I knew why I was hurt so much.\"\\n\\nStill Sunday said nothing, but only sat with his mighty chin upon\\nhis hand, and gazed at the distance. Then at last he said--\\n\\n\"I have heard your complaints in order. And here, I think, comes\\nanother to complain, and we will hear him also.\"\\n\\nThe falling fire in the great cresset threw a last long gleam, like\\na bar of burning gold, across the dim grass. Against this fiery\\nband was outlined in utter black the advancing legs of a black-clad\\nfigure. He seemed to have a fine close suit with knee-breeches such\\nas that which was worn by the servants of the house, only that it\\nwas not blue, but of this absolute sable. He had, like the\\nservants, a kind of word by his side. It was only when he had come\\nquite close to the crescent of the seven and flung up his face to\\nlook at them, that Syme saw, with thunder-struck clearness, that\\nthe face was the broad, almost ape-like face of his old friend\\nGregory, with its rank red hair and its insulting smile.\\n\\n\"Gregory!\" gasped Syme, half-rising from his seat. \"Why, this is\\nthe real anarchist!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Gregory, with a great and dangerous restraint, \"I am\\nthe real anarchist.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Now there was a day,\\'\" murmured Bull, who seemed really to have\\nfallen asleep, \"\\'when the sons of God came to present themselves\\nbefore the Lord, and Satan came also among them.\\'\"\\n\\n\"You are right,\" said Gregory, and gazed all round. \"I am a\\ndestroyer. I would destroy the world if I could.\"\\n\\nA sense of a pathos far under the earth stirred up in Syme, and\\nhe spoke brokenly and without sequence.\\n\\n\"Oh, most unhappy man,\" he cried, \"try to be happy! You have red\\nhair like your sister.\"\\n\\n\"My red hair, like red flames, shall burn up the world,\" said\\nGregory. \"I thought I hated everything more than common men can\\nhate anything; but I find that I do not hate everything so much\\nas I hate you! \"\\n\\n\"I never hated you,\" said Syme very sadly.\\n\\nThen out of this unintelligible creature the last thunders broke.\\n\\n\"You!\" he cried. \"You never hated because you never lived. I know\\nwhat you are all of you, from first to last--you are the people\\nin power! You are the police--the great fat, smiling men in blue\\nand buttons! You are the Law, and you have never been broken. But\\nis there a free soul alive that does not long to break you, only\\nbecause you have never been broken? We in revolt talk all kind of\\nnonsense doubtless about this crime or that crime of the\\nGovernment. It is all folly! The only crime of the Government is\\nthat it governs. The unpardonable sin of the supreme power is\\nthat it is supreme. I do not curse you for being cruel. I do not\\ncurse you (though I might) for being kind. I curse you for being\\nsafe! You sit in your chairs of stone, and have never come down\\nfrom them. You are the seven angels of heaven, and you have had\\nno troubles. Oh, I could forgive you everything, you that rule\\nall mankind, if I could feel for once that you had suffered for\\none hour a real agony such as I--\"\\n\\nSyme sprang to his feet, shaking from head to foot.\\n\\n\"I see everything,\" he cried, \"everything that there is. Why does\\neach thing on the earth war against each other thing? Why does\\neach small thing in the world have to fight against the world\\nitself? Why does a fly have to fight the whole universe? Why does\\na dandelion have to fight the whole universe? For the same reason\\nthat I had to be alone in the dreadful Council of the Days. So\\nthat each thing that obeys law may have the glory and isolation of\\nthe anarchist. So that each man fighting for order may be as brave\\nand good a man as the dynamiter. So that the real lie of Satan may\\nbe flung back in the face of this blasphemer, so that by tears and\\ntorture we may earn the right to say to this man, \\'You lie!\\' No\\nagonies can be too great to buy the right to say to this accuser,\\n\\'We also have suffered.\\'\\n\\n\"It is not true that we have never been broken. We have been broken\\nupon the wheel. It is not true that we have never descended from\\nthese thrones. We have descended into hell. We were complaining of\\nunforgettable miseries even at the very moment when this man\\nentered insolently to accuse us of happiness. I repel the slander;\\nwe have not been happy. I can answer for every one of the great\\nguards of Law whom he has accused. At least--\"\\n\\nHe had turned his eyes so as to see suddenly the great face of\\nSunday, which wore a strange smile.\\n\\n\"Have you,\" he cried in a dreadful voice, \"have you ever suffered?\"\\n\\nAs he gazed, the great face grew to an awful size, grew larger than\\nthe colossal mask of Memnon, which had made him scream as a child.\\nIt grew larger and larger, filling the whole sky; then everything\\nwent black. Only in the blackness before it entirely destroyed his\\nbrain he seemed to hear a distant voice saying a commonplace text\\nthat he had heard somewhere, \"Can ye drink of the cup that I drink\\nof?\"\\n\\n*    *    *\\n\\nWhen men in books awake from a vision, they commonly find\\nthemselves in some place in which they might have fallen asleep;\\nthey yawn in a chair, or lift themselves with bruised limbs from a\\nfield. Syme\\'s experience was something much more psychologically\\nstrange if there was indeed anything unreal, in the earthly sense,\\nabout the things he had gone through. For while he could always\\nremember afterwards that he had swooned before the face of Sunday,\\nhe could not remember having ever come to at all. He could only\\nremember that gradually and naturally he knew that he was and had\\nbeen walking along a country lane with an easy and conversational\\ncompanion. That companion had been a part of his recent drama; it\\nwas the red-haired poet Gregory. They were walking like old\\nfriends, and were in the middle of a conversation about some\\ntriviality. But Syme could only feel an unnatural buoyancy in his\\nbody and a crystal simplicity in his mind that seemed to be\\nsuperior to everything that he said or did. He felt he was in\\npossession of some impossible good news, which made every other\\nthing a triviality, but an adorable triviality.\\n\\nDawn was breaking over everything in colours at once clear and\\ntimid; as if Nature made a first attempt at yellow and a first\\nattempt at rose. A breeze blew so clean and sweet, that one could\\nnot think that it blew from the sky; it blew rather through some\\nhole in the sky. Syme felt a simple surprise when he saw rising all\\nround him on both sides of the road the red, irregular buildings of\\nSaffron Park. He had no idea that he had walked so near London. He\\nwalked by instinct along one white road, on which early birds\\nhopped and sang, and found himself outside a fenced garden. There\\nhe saw the sister of Gregory, the girl with the gold-red hair,\\ncutting lilac before breakfast, with the great unconscious gravity\\nof a girl.\\n\\n'"
